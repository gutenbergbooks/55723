<h2 class="nobreak">THE WHITE GHOST OF DISASTER</h2></div>


<p>We had been sitting in at the game for more
than an hour, and no life had entered it.
The thoughts of all composing that little
group of five in the most secluded corner of the
ship's smoking room were certainly not on the
game, and three aces lay down to fours up.</p>

<p>The morose and listless ship's officer out of a
berth, although he spoke little&mdash;if at all&mdash;seemed
to put a spell of uneasiness and unrest on the party.
The others did not know him or his history; but his
looks spelled disaster and misfortune.</p>

<p>At last Charlie Spangler, the noted journalist,
keen for a story or two, threw down his cards, exclaiming:
"Let's quit. None of us is less uneasy
than the rest of the ship's passengers."</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in Arthur Linch, the noted stock-broker.
"We have endeavored to banish the all-pervading
thought, 'will the ship arrive safely without
being wrecked,' and have failed miserably.
Cards will not do it." This seemed to express the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
sentiments of everybody except the morose mariner,
whose thoughts nobody could read or fathom. He
sat there, deep in his chair, gazing at a scene or
scenes none of us could see or appreciate.</p>

<p>"Well! Since we cannot take our thoughts off
'shipwreck,' we may as well discuss the subject and
ease our minds," added the journalist again, still
hot on the scent of the possible story which he felt
that the ship's officer hoarded.</p>

<p>The mariner, however, did not respond to this,
and continued with his memories, apparently oblivious
of our presence.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of the journalist the discussion
waxed warm for some time, until the stock-broker,
ever solicitous for the welfare of the stock-market
and conforming his opinions thereto, exclaimed
loudly: "The officers and the crew were
not responsible for the collision with the berg. It
was an 'act of God!' and as such we are daily taking
chances with it. What will be, will be. We cannot
escape Destiny!"</p>

<p>"Destiny be damned!" came like a thunderbolt
from the heretofore silent mariner, and we all
looked to see the face now full of rage and
passion. "What do you know of the sea, you land
pirate? What do you know of sea dangers and responsibility
for the safety of human lives? Man!
you're crazy. There is no such thing as Destiny at
sea. A seaman knows what to expect when he
takes chances. If you call that an 'act of God,' you
deserve to have been there and submitted to it."</p>

<p>The face of Charlie Spangler was glowing. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
heart beat so fast when he heard this sea clam open
up, that he was afraid it might overwork and stop.
"Our friend is right!" he exclaimed. "I infer that
he speaks from knowledge and experience. We are
hardly qualified to discuss such matters properly.</p>

<p>"You have something on your mind, friend. Unburden
it to us. We are sympathetic, you know.
Our position here makes us so," saying which,
Spangler filled the mariner's half-empty glass and
looked at him with sympathy streaming out of his
trained eyes. We all nodded our assent.</p>

<p>Having fortified himself with the contents of the
glass before him, the mariner spoke: "Yes, gentlemen,
I am going to speak from knowledge and experience.
It was my luck to be aboard of the
vessel which had the shortest of lives, but which
will live in the memory of man for many a year.</p>

<p>"It is my misfortune to be one of its surviving
officers. I am going to give you the facts as they
happened this last time, and a few other times besides.
It is the experiences through which I have
passed that make me wish I had gone down with
the last one. I must now live on with memories,
indelibly stamped on my brain, which I would
gladly forget. Your attention, gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Captain Brownson came upon the bridge. It was
early morning, and the liner was tearing through a
smooth sea in about forty-three north latitude.
The sun had not yet risen, but the gray of the coming
daylight showed a heaving swell that rolled
with the steadiness that told of a long stretch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
calm water behind it. The men of the morning
watch showed their pale faces white with that
peculiar pallor which comes from the loss of the
healthful sleep between midnight and morning. It
was the second mate's watch, and that officer
greeted the commander as he came to the bridge
rail where the mate stood staring into the gray
ahead.</p>

<p>"See anything?" asked the master curtly.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;but I smell it&mdash;feel it," said the mate,
without turning his head.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Brownson.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel it?&mdash;the chill, the&mdash;well, it's ice,
sir&mdash;ice, if I know anything."</p>

<p>"Ice?" snarled the captain. "You're crazy!
What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well&mdash;you asked me&mdash;I told you&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>The captain snorted. He disliked the second officer
exceedingly. Mr. Smith had been sent him by
the company at the request of the manager of the
London office. He had always picked his own men,
and he resented the office picking them for him. Besides,
he had a nephew, a passenger aboard, who
was an officer out of a berth.</p>

<p>"What the devil do they know of a man, anyhow!
I'm the one responsible for him. I'm the
one, then, to choose him. They won't let me shift
blame if anything happens, and yet they sent me
a man I know nothing of except that he is young
and strong. I'll wake him up some if he stays
here." So he had commented to Mr. Wylie, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
chief mate. Mr. Wylie had listened, thought over
the matter, and nodded his head sagely.</p>

<p>"Sure," he vouchsafed; "sure thing." That was
as much as any one ever got out of Wylie. He was
not a talkative mate. Yet when he knew Smith
better, he retailed the master's conversation to him
during a spell of generosity engendered by the donation
of a few highballs by Macdowell, the chief
engineer. Smith thanked him&mdash;and went his way
as before, trying to do the best he could. He did
not shirk duty on that account. Wylie insisted that
the captain was right. A master was responsible,
and it was always customary for him to pick his
men as far as possible. Besides, as Wylie had
learned from Macdowell, Brownson had a nephew
in view that would have filled the berth about right&mdash;so
Wylie thought&mdash;and Smith was a nuisance.
Smith had taken it all in good part, and smiled.
He liked Wylie.</p>

<p>Brownson sniffed the air hungrily as he stood
there at the bridge rail. The air was chilly, but it
was always chilly in that latitude even in summer.</p>

<p>"How does she head?" he asked savagely of the
man at the steam-steering gear. The man spoke
through the pilot-house window in a monotone:</p>

<p>"West&mdash;three degrees south, sir."</p>

<p>"That's west&mdash;one south by standard?" snapped
Brownson.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Smith.</p>

<p>"Let her go west&mdash;two south by binnacle&mdash;and
mark the time accurately," ordered Brownson.</p>

<p>He would shift her a bit. The cool air seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
to come from the northward. It was as if a door
in an ice box were suddenly opened and the cold air
within let out in a cold, damp mass. A thin haze
covered the sea. The side wash rolled away noisily,
and disappeared into the mist a few fathoms from
the ship's side. It seemed to thicken as the minutes
passed.</p>

<p>Brownson was nervous. He went inside the pilot
house and spoke to the engineer through the tube
leading to the engine room.</p>

<p>"How is she going?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred and ten, sir; never less than two
and five the watch."</p>

<p>"Well, she's going too almighty fast&mdash;shut her
down to one hundred," snapped Brownson. "She's
been doing twenty-two knots&mdash;it's too fast&mdash;too
fast, anyhow, in this weather. Ten knots will do
until the sun scoffs off this mist. Shut her down."</p>

<p>The slowing engines eased their vibrations, and
the side wash rolled less noisily. There was a
strange stillness over the sea. The silence grew as
the headway subsided.</p>

<p>The captain listened intently. He felt something.</p>

<p>There is always that strange something that a
seaman feels in the presence of great danger when
awake. It has never been explained. But all good&mdash;really
good&mdash;masters have felt it; can tell you of
it if they will. It is uncanny, but it is as true as
gospel. The second officer had felt it in the air,
felt it in his nerves. He felt&mdash;<i>ice</i>. It was danger.</p>

<p>Smith stood there watching the haze that seemed
to deepen rather than disperse as the morning grew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
The men turned out and the hose was started, the
decks were sluiced down, and the gang with the
squeegees followed. Two bells struck&mdash;five o'clock.
Smith strained his gaze straight into the haze
ahead. He fixed and refixed his glasses&mdash;a pair of
powerful lenses of fifteen lines. He had bought
them for fifty dollars, and always kept them near
him while on watch.</p>

<p>A man came up the bridge steps.</p>

<p>"Shall I send up your coffee, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, send it up," said Smith, in a whisper. He
was listening.</p>

<p>Something sounded out there in the haze. It was
a strange, vibrating sound, a sort of whispering
murmur, soft and low, like the far-away notes of a
harp. Then it ceased. Smith looked at the captain
who stood within the pilot-house window gazing
down at the men at work on the deck below. The
noise of the rushing water from the hose and their
low tones seemed to annoy him. They wore rubber
boots, and their footsteps were silent; but he gruffly
ordered the bos'n to make them "shut up."</p>

<p>"Better slow her down, sir&mdash;there's ice somewhere
about here," said the second mate anxiously.
He was thinking of the thousand and more souls
below and the millions in cargo values.</p>

<p>"Who's running this ship&mdash;me or you?" snarled
Brownson savagely.</p>

<p>It was an unnecessary remark, wholly uncalled
for. Smith flushed under his tan and pallor. He
had seldom been spoken to like that. He would
have to stand it; but he would hunt a new ship as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
soon as he came ashore again. It was bad enough
to be treated like a boy; but to be talked to that
way before the men made it impossible, absolutely
impossible. It meant the end of discipline at once.
A man would retail it, more would repeat it, and&mdash;then&mdash;Smith
turned away from the bridge rail in
utter disgust. He was furious.</p>

<p>"Blast the ship!" he muttered, as he turned away
and gazed aft. His interest was over, entirely over.
He would not have heard a gun fired at that moment,
so furious was the passion at the unmerited
insolence from his commander.</p>

<p>And then, as if to give insult to injury, Brownson
called down the tube:</p>

<p>"Full speed ahead&mdash;give her all she'll do&mdash;I'm
tired of loafing around here all the morning." Then
he rang up the telegraph, and the sudden vibrations
told of a giant let loose below.</p>

<p>The <i>Admiral</i> started ahead slowly. She was a
giant liner, a ship of eight hundred feet in length.
It took some moments to get headway upon that
vast hull. But she started, and in a few minutes
the snoring of the bow wave told of a tearing speed.
She was doing twenty-two and a half knots an hour,
or more than twenty-five miles, the speed of a train
of cars.</p>

<p>The under steward came up the bridge steps with
the coffee. Smith took his cup and drank it greedily,
almost savagely. He was much hurt. His
feelings had been roughly handled. Yet he had
not even answered the captain back. He took his
place at the bridge rail and gazed straight ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
into the gray mist. He saw nothing, felt nothing,
but the pain of his insult.</p>

<p>"Let him run the ship to hell and back," he said
to himself.</p>

<p>There was a puff of colder air than usual. A
chill as of death itself came floating over the silent
ocean. A man on lookout stood staring straight
into the mist ahead, and then sang out:</p>

<p>"Something right ahead, sir," he yelled in a voice
that carried like the roar of a gun.</p>

<p>Brownson just seized the lever shutting the compartments,
swung it, jammed it hard over, and
screamed:</p>

<p>"Stop her&mdash;stop her&mdash;hard over your wheel&mdash;hard
over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice ended in a vibrating screech that
sounded wild, weird, uncanny in that awful silence.
A hundred men stopped in their stride, or work,
paralyzed at the tones coming from the bridge.</p>

<p>And then came the impact.</p>

<p>With a grinding, smashing roar as of thousands
of tons coming together, the huge liner plunged
headlong into the iceberg that rose grim and silent
right ahead, towering over her in spite of her great
height. The shock was terrific, and the grinding,
thundering crash of falling tons of ice, coupled with
the rending of steel plates and solid planks, made
chaos of all sound.</p>

<p>The <i>Admiral</i> bit in, dug, plowed, kept on going,
going, and the whole forward part of her almost
disappeared into the wall of white. A thousand tons
of huge flakes slammed and slid down her decks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
burying her to the fore hatch in the smother. A
thousand tons more crashed, slid, and plunged down
the slopes of the icy mountain and hurled themselves
into the sea with giant splashes, sending torrents
of water as high as the bridge rail. The men
who had been forward were swept away by the
avalanche. Many were never seen again. And
then, with reversed engines, she finally came to a
dead stop, with her bows jammed a hundred feet
deep in the ice wall of the berg.</p>

<p>After that it was panic. All discipline seemed
to end in the shock and struggle. Brownson howled
and stormed from the bridge, and Smith shouted
orders and sprang down to enforce them. The chief
mate came on deck in his underclothes and passed
the word to man the boats. A thousand passengers
jammed the companionway and strove with panic
and inhuman fury to reach the deck.</p>

<p>One man clad in a night robe gained the outside
of the press, and, running swiftly along the deck,
flitted like a ghost over the rail, and disappeared
into the sea. He had gone crazy, violently insane
in the panic.</p>

<p>Brownson tied down the siren cord, and the roar
shook the atmosphere. The tremendous tones rose
above the din of screaming men and cursing seamen;
and then the master called down to the heart
of the ship, the engine room.</p>

<p>"Is she going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Water coming in like through a tunnel," came
the response. "Nearly up to the grates now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was all. The man left the tube to rush on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
deck, and the captain knew the forward bulkheads
had gone; had either jammed or burst under that
terrific impact. The ship was going down.</p>

<p>Brownson stood upon the bridge and gazed down
at the human tide below him. Men fought furiously
for places in the small boats. The fireroom
crew came on deck and mingled with the passengers.
The coal dust showed upon their white faces,
making them seem strange beings from an inferno
that was soon to be abolished. They strove for
places in the lifeboats and hurled the weaker passengers
about recklessly. Some, on the other hand,
helped the women. One man dragged two women
with him into a boat, kicking, twisting, and roaring
like a lion. He was a big fellow with a red beard,
and Brownson watched him. The mate struck him
over the head with a hand spike for refusing to
get out of the boat, and his interest in things ended
at once and forever.</p>

<p>The crew, on the whole, behaved well. Officers
and men tried to keep some sort of discipline. Finally
six boats went down alongside into the sea,
and were promptly swarmed by the crowds above,
who either slid down the falls or jumped overboard
and climbed in from the sides. The sea was as still
as a lake; only the slight swell heaved it. Great
fields of floating particles of ice from the berg
floated about, and those who were drenched in the
spray shivered with the cold.</p>

<p>The <i>Admiral</i>, running at twenty-two knots an
hour, had struck straight into the wall of an iceberg
that reached as far as the eye could see in the haze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
It towered at least three hundred feet in the air,
showing that its depth was colossal, probably at
least half a mile. It was a giant ice mountain that
had broken adrift from its northern home, and,
drifting southward, had survived the heat of summer
and the breaking of the sea upon its base.</p>

<p>Smith had felt its dread presence, felt its proximity
long before he had come to close quarters.
The chill in the air, the peculiar feeling of danger,
the icy breath of death&mdash;all had told him of a danger
that was near. And yet Brownson had scoffed
at him, railed at his intuition and sense. Upon the
captain the whole blame of the disaster must fall if
Smith told.</p>

<p>The second officer almost smiled as he struggled
with his boat.</p>

<p>"The pig-headed fool!" he muttered between his
set teeth. "The murdering monster&mdash;he's done it
now! He's killed himself, and a thousand people
along with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Smith fought savagely for the discipline of his
boat. His men had rushed to their stations at the
first call. The deck was beginning to slant dangerously
as the falls were slacked off and the lifeboat
lowered into the sea. Smith stood in the press
about him and grew strangely calm. The action was
good for him, good for the burning fury that had
warped him, scorched him like a hot blast while he
had stood silently upon the bridge and taken the
insults of his commander. Women pleaded with
him for places in the boat. Men begged and took
hold of him. One lady, half clothed, dropped upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
her knees and, holding his hand, which hung at his
side, prayed to him as if he were a deity, a being
to whom all should defer. He flung her off savagely.</p>

<p>Bareheaded now, coatless, and with his shirt
ripped, he stood there, and saw his men pass down
sixteen women into his craft; pass them down without
comment or favor, age or condition. Thirty
souls went into his boat before he sprang into the
falls and slid down himself. A dozen men tried to
follow him, but he shoved off, and they went into
the sea. His men got their oars out and rowed off
a short distance.</p>

<p>Muttering, praying, and crying, the passengers in
his boat huddled themselves in her bottom. He
spoke savagely to them, ordered them under pain
of death to sit down. One man, who shivered as
he spoke, insisted upon crawling about and shifting
his position. Smith struck him over the head,
knocking him senseless. Another, a woman, must
stand upon the thwarts, to get as far away as possible
from the dread and icy element about her. He
swung his fist upon her jaw, and she went whimpering
down into the boat's bottom, lying there and
sobbing softly.</p>

<p>Furiously swearing at the herd of helpless passengers
who endangered his boat at every movement,
he swung the craft's head about and stood
gazing at his ship. After a little while the crowd
became more manageable, and he saw he could keep
them aboard without the certainty of upsetting the
craft He had just been debating which of them he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
would throw overboard to save the rest; save them
from their own struggling and fighting for their
own selfish ends. He was as cold as steel, hard, inflexible.
His men knew him for a ship's officer who
would maintain his place under all hazards, and
they watched him furtively, and were ready to obey
him to the end without question.</p>

<p>"Oh, the monster, the murdering monster!" he
muttered again and again.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed upon the bridge. High up
there stood Brownson&mdash;the captain who had sent
his liner to her death, with hundreds of passengers.</p>

<p>Brownson stood calmly watching the press gain
and lose places in the boats. Two boats actually
overloaded rolled over under the immense load of
human freight. The others did not stop to pick
them up. They had enough to do to save themselves.
The ship was sinking. That was certain.
She must have struck so hard that even the 'midship
bulkheads gave way, or were so twisted out of
place that the doors failed. The chief engineer
came below him and glanced up.</p>

<p>As he did so, a tremendous, roaring blast of
steam blew the superstructure upward. The boilers
had gone. Macdowell just gave Brownson a look.
That was all. Then he rushed for a boat.</p>

<p>Brownson grinned; actually smiled at him.</p>

<p>The man at the wheel asked permission to go.</p>

<p>"I'm a married man, sir&mdash;it's no use of me staying
here any longer," he ventured.</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;go to the devil!" said Brownson, without
interest. The man fled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Brownson stopped giving any more orders. In
silence he gazed down at the press of human beings,
watching, debating within himself the chances they
had of getting away from that scene of death and
horror.</p>

<p>The decks grew more and more steep. The liner
was settling by the head and to starboard. She was
even now twisting, rolling over; and the motion
brought down thousands of blocks of ice from the
berg. The engines had long since stopped. She
still held her head against the ice wall; but it would
give her no support. She was slipping away&mdash;down
to her grave below.</p>

<p>Brownson gazed back over the decks. He
watched the crowd impersonally, and it seemed
strange to him that so much valuable fabric should
go to the bottom so quickly. The paint was so
clean and bright, the brass was so shiny. The whole
structure was so thoroughly clean, neat, and in
proper order. It was absurd. There he was standing
upon that bridge where he had stood so often, and
here below him were hundreds of dying people&mdash;people
like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>"Good Heaven&mdash;is it real?"</p>

<p>He was sure he was not awake. It must be a
dream. Then the terrible knowledge came back
upon him like a stroke; a blow that stopped his
heart. It was the death of his ship he was watching&mdash;the
death of his ship and of many of his passengers.
Suddenly Brownson saw the boat of the
second mate, and that officer standing looking up at
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>The master thought he saw the officer's lips move.
He wondered what the man thought, what he would
say. He had insulted the officer, made him a clown
before the men. He knew the second mate would
not spare him. He knew the second mate would
testify that he had given warning of ice ten minutes
before they struck. He also knew that the man
at the wheel had heard him, as had the steward who
brought up the coffee, and one or two others who
were near.</p>

<p>No, there must be no investigation of his, Brownson's,
blame in the matter. The master dared not
face that. He looked vacantly at Smith. The officer
stood gazing straight at him.</p>

<p>The liner suddenly shifted, leaned to starboard,
heeled far over, and her bows slipped from the berg,
sinking down clear to her decks, clear down until
the seas washed to the foot of her superstructure
just below Brownson. Masses of ice fell from her
into the sea. The grinding, splashing noise awoke
the panic again among the remaining passengers
and crew. They strove with maniac fury to get the
rafts and other stuff that might float over the side.
Two boats drew away full to the gunwales with
people. The air below began to make that peculiar
whistling sound that tells of pressure&mdash;pressure
upon the vitals of the ship. She was going down.</p>

<p>Brownson still stood gazing at his second mate.</p>

<p>Smith met the master's eye with a steady look.
Then he suddenly forgot himself and raised his
hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"Oh, you murdering rat, you cowardly scoundrel,
you devil!" he roared out.</p>

<p>Brownson saw the movement of the hand, saw
that it was vindictive, furious, and full of menace.
He could not hear the words.</p>

<p>He smiled at the officer, raised his hand, and
waved it in reply. It seemed to make the mate
crazy. He gesticulated wildly, swore like a maniac&mdash;but
Brownson did not hear him. He only knew
what he was doing.</p>

<p>He turned away, gave one more look over the
sinking ship.</p>

<p>"She's going now&mdash;and so am I," he muttered.</p>

<p>Then he went slowly into his chart room, opened
a drawer, and took out a revolver that he always
kept there. He stood at the open door and cocked
the weapon. He looked into its muzzle, and saw the
bullet that would end his life when he pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>He almost shuddered. It was so unreal. He
could not quite do it. He gazed again at the second
mate. He knew the officer was watching him, knew
Smith would not believe he had the nerve to end the
thing then and there. It amused him slightly in a
grim sort of way. Why, he <i>must</i> die. That was
certain. He could never face his own family and
friends after what he had done. As to getting another
ship&mdash;that was too absurd to think of.</p>

<p>The form of a woman showed in the boat. She
had risen from the bottom, where the blow of the
officer had felled her in her frenzy. Brownson saw
her, recognized her as his niece, the sister of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
man he had wished to put in Smith's place. It was
for his own nephew he had insulted his officer, had
caused him to relax and lose the interest that made
navigation safe, in the hope that Smith would leave
and let his relative get the berth.</p>

<p>He wondered if Smith knew. He stood there
with the revolver in his hand watching for some
sign from his second officer. Smith gazed at him
in fury, apparently not noticing the girl whom he
had just before knocked into the boat's bottom to
keep order. She stood up. Smith roughly pushed
her down again. Brownson was sure now&mdash;he felt
that Smith knew all.</p>

<p>But he put the revolver in his pocket. He would
not fire yet.</p>

<p>The ship was listing heavily, and the cries of the
passengers were dying out. All who had been able
to get away had gone, somehow, and only a few
desperate men and women, who could not swim and
who were cool enough to realize that swimming
would but prolong an agony that was better over
quickly, huddled aft at the taffrail. They would
take the last second left them, the last instant of
life, and suffer a thousand deaths every second to
get it. It was absurd. Brownson pitied them.</p>

<p>Many of these women were praying and talking
to their men, who held them in a last embrace. One
young woman was clinging closely to a young man,
and they were apparently not suffering terror. A
look of peacefulness was upon the faces of both.
They were lovers, and were satisfied to die together;
and the thought of it made them satisfied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Brownson wondered at this. They were young
enough and strong enough to make a fight for life.</p>

<p>A whistling roar, arose above all other sounds.
The siren had ceased, and Brownson knew the air
was rushing from below. The ship would drop in
a moment. He grasped the pistol again. He
dreaded that last plunge, that drop into the void
below. The thought held him a little. The ocean
was always so blue out there, so clear and apparently
bottomless, a great void of water. He wondered
at the depth, what kind of a dark bed would
receive that giant fabric, the work of so many human
hands. And then he wondered at his own end
there. His own end? What nonsense! It was unreal.
Death was always for others. It had never
been for him. He had seen men die. It was not
for him yet. He would not believe it. He would
awaken soon, and the steward would bring him his
coffee.</p>

<p>Then he caught the eye of Smith again in that
boat waiting for the end out there. His heart gave
an immense jolt, began beating wildly. The ship
heeled more and more. The ice crashed and
plunged from her forward. Brownson was awakening
to the real at last. He felt it in those extra
heartbeats; knew he must hurry it. Then he wondered
what the papers would say; whether they
would call him a coward, afraid to face the inevitable.
He hoped they would not. But, then, what
difference would it all make, anyhow&mdash;to him? He
was dead. His interest was over. What difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
would it make whether he was a coward or not?
Men knew him for what he was, but he existed no
longer. He was dead.</p>

<p>While he stood there with these thoughts in his
mind, his nerve half lacking to end the thing, it
seemed to him it was lasting for an eternity. He
was growing tired of it all. He turned away again
and entered the chart room.</p>

<p>His cat crawled from somewhere and rubbed its
tail and side against his leg. Then the animal
jumped to the table, and he stroked it; actually
stroked it while Smith watched him, and swore at
him for a cold-blooded scoundrel.</p>

<p>The ship sank to her superstructure. Her stern
rose high in the air. It was now impossible to
stand on deck without holding on. Some of the
remaining passengers slid off with parting shrieks.
They dropped into that icy sea.</p>

<p>Brownson felt the end coming now, and turned
again to the doorway, looking straight at his second
mate. Smith was trying to quell the movement
among his crowd which was endangering his boat
again.</p>

<p>The captain clutched the door jamb and watched.
Then the ship began to sink. He could not make up
his mind to jump clear. There was Smith looking
at him. He dared not be saved when hundreds
were being killed. No, he could not make that
jump and swim to a boat under that officer's gaze.
And yet at the last moment he was about to try it.
Panic was upon him in a way that he hardly realized.
He simply could not face the black gulf he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
was dropping into with his health and full physical
powers still with him. It was nature to make a last
effort for his life. Then, before he could make the
jump overboard, he saw Smith again shaking his
hand at him and howling curses.</p>

<p>He pulled the pistol. An ashy whiteness came
over his face. Smith saw it. He stopped swearing;
stopped in his furious denunciation of the man
who had caused so much destruction. He also saw
the pistol plainly, and wondered at the captain's
nerve.</p>

<p>"You are afraid, you dog&mdash;you are afraid&mdash;you
daren't do it, you murdering rat!" he yelled.</p>

<p>The men in the boat were all gazing up at the
chart-house door where the form of their commander
stood.</p>

<p>"He's going to shoot, sir," said the stroke oarsman.</p>

<p>"He's afraid&mdash;he won't dare!" howled Smith.</p>

<p>Brownson seemed to hear now. The silence was
coming again, and the sounds on the sinking ship
were dying out.</p>

<p>Brownson gazed straight at his second officer.
Smith saw him raise the pistol, saw a bit of blue
smoke, saw his commander sink down to the deck
and disappear. A cracking and banging of ice
blocks blended with the report, and the ship raised
her stern higher. Then she plunged straight downward,
straight as a plummet for the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean. Smith knew his captain had gone
to his end; that he was a dead man at last.</p>

<p>He stood watching the mighty swirl where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
liner had gone under. The men in his boat were
also looking. They had seen all.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;look!" shrieked a passenger. "The captain
has shot himself!"</p>

<p>"She's gone&mdash;gone for good!" cried another.
"Oh, the pity of it all!"</p>

<p>Smith did not reply. He was still gazing at the
apparition he had seen in that chart-house door; the
figure of the man shooting himself through the
head. It had chilled his anger, staggered him. The
awful nerve of it all, the horror&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better see if we can get one or two
more in her, sir?" asked the stroke oarsman. "I see
a woman swimming there."</p>

<p>Smith did not answer. He seemed not to hear.
Then he suddenly awoke to his surroundings. He
was alive to the occasion, the desperate situation.</p>

<p>"Give way port&mdash;ease starboard&mdash;swing her out
of that swirl&mdash;hard on that port oar," he ordered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Smith looked around for the other boats. The
chief mate's was in sight, showing dimly through
the haze. She was full of people, crowded, and it
was a wonder how she floated with the screaming,
panic-stricken passengers, who fought for places in
her in spite of Wylie's oaths and entreaties. Smith
glared.</p>

<p>"The fools!" he muttered. "If they would only
think of something besides their own hides for a
second. But they won't. They never do. It's nature,
and when the trouble comes they fight like
cats."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>He steered away from what he saw was trouble.
He would not pick up the participants in the scuffle
when they overturned the boat. He was full up
now, carrying all his boat would hold. She rocked
dangerously with every shifting of the crowd, that
still trembled and scuffled for more comfort in her.
Her gunwales were only a few inches above the
sea, and it might come on to blow at any minute.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" he roared to the old man, who would
shift and squirm about in the boat, interfering with
the stroke oarsman, who jammed his oar into the
small of the fellow's back, regardless of the pain it
caused.</p>

<p>"Sit down or I'll throw you overboard! Do you
hear?"</p>

<p>The old man whimpered and struggled for a more
comfortable position; and Smith reached over with
the tiller and slammed him heavily across the shoulders,
knocking him over.</p>

<p>"If you get up again I'll kill you, you cowardly
old nuisance!" he said savagely.</p>

<p>The old man lay quiet and trembling. A young
woman upbraided Smith for brutality and talked
volubly.</p>

<p>"Talk, you little fool!" he said. "Talk all you
want to, but don't you get moving about in this
boat, or I'll break your pretty neck."</p>

<p>"You are a monster," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes; but if I'd had my way, you would have
been safe and sound below in your room instead of
out here in this ice," snapped Smith.</p>

<p>The girl quieted down, and then spoke to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
young woman, who lay in the bottom of the boat
where she had fallen when Smith struck her down.
She was the niece of Captain Brownson.</p>

<p>"I never heard of such utter brutality in my life,"
she said.</p>

<p>Miss Billings, who had first found fault, agreed
with her.</p>

<p>"Was your brother aboard, Miss Roberts?" asked
Smith.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was&mdash;I think he went in the mate's boat&mdash;why
do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was just thinking&mdash;that's all. He would
have been second officer next voyage. That seemed
to be fixed, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and if it had, this thing would not have
happened," said the girl.</p>

<p>"No; probably it would not," said the second officer
sadly. He spoke, for the first time, with less
passion. He thought of the manner they had taken
to get his berth, the insults, the infamy of the whole
thing.</p>

<p>"No; I don't suppose you knew how it was done,"
said he, half aloud.</p>

<p>The girl sat up. She had stopped whimpering
from the blow.</p>

<p>Smith watched her for a few minutes while he
swung the boat's head for the gray mist ahead
where he knew lay the iceberg. He thought the
face pretty, the figure well rounded and perfectly
shaped. He felt sorry he had used such harshness
in making her behave in the boat. But there was
no time for silly sentiment. That boat must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
manned properly and kept afloat, and the slapping of
a girl was nothing at all. She might start a sudden
movement and endanger the lives of all. Absolute
trimming of the craft was the only way she could
be safe to carry the immense load. The men rowed
slowly and apparently without object. Smith
headed the boat for the ice.</p>

<p>A long wall of peculiar pale blueness suddenly
burst from the haze close to them. It was the iceberg.
He swung the boat so that she would not
strike it, and followed along the ragged side.</p>

<p>The two young women gazed up at the pale blueness
caused by the fresh water in the ice. It was
a beautiful sight. The pinnacles were sharp as
needles, and they pierced the mist in white points,
tapering down to the white-and-blue sheen at the
base, where the ocean roared and surged in a deep-toned
murmur. Great pieces broke from the mass
while they gazed. Smith steered out and sheered
the boat's head away from the dangerous wall. It
was grand but deadly. A large block lay right
ahead.</p>

<p>"Ease starboard," he said.</p>

<p>The craft swung clear. The mist from the cold
ocean thinned a little. Right ahead was a flat plateau,
a raised field of ice joining the berg. It sloped
down suddenly to the sea, and the swell broke upon
it as upon a rocky shore. A long, flat floe stretched
away from the higher part. It was a field of at
least a half mile in length. The huge berg reached
a full half mile further. The whole was evidently
broken from some giant glacier in the Arctic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Smith debated his chances within himself. He
scorned to ask his men, for he had seen much ice
before in his seagoing. To remain near the berg
was to miss a ship possibly; but to row far off was
to miss fresh water. He had come away without
either food or water, owing to the furious panic.
He knew very well that, within a few hours at
most, the famished folk in his boat would rave for a
drink. They must have water, at least, even if they
must do without food.</p>

<p>The iceberg lay right in the path of ships, as his
own had proved, the liner running upon the great
circle from New York to Liverpool. There was
the certainty of meeting, or of at least coming close
to a vessel shortly, for others of his line would run
the same circle, the same course, as he had run it
before.</p>

<p>With giant liners going at twenty-five knots
speed, they usually kept pretty close to the same line,
for there were few currents that were not accurately
known over that route. The Gulf Stream was a
fixed unit almost; and in calm weather other ships
would certainly reckon with accuracy to meet its
set. If he rowed far off the line, then he might or
might not meet a ship. If he did not, then there
would soon be death and terror in that boat.</p>

<p>He decided to keep close to the berg, and ordered
his men to give way slowly while he navigated the
field and skirted it, keeping just far enough out to
avoid the dangerous breaks and floating pieces.</p>

<p>The morning wore away, and the occupants of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
boat began to grow restless. They had been
cramped up for several hours now, and they were
not used to sitting in a cold, open boat in a thick,
misty haze without food or water. The old man
began to complain. Several women began to ask
for water. One woman with three children begged
him to go ashore and get them a piece of ice to allay
their thirst. Smith saw that the effects of the
wild excitement were now being felt, and the inevitable
thirst that must follow was at hand.</p>

<p>He headed the boat for a low part of the field.</p>

<p>"Easy on your oars," he commanded. The boat
slid gently upon the sloping ice.</p>

<p>"Jump out, Sam," he said to the bow oarsman.
"Jump out and take the painter with you." The
man did so, hauling the line far up the floe.</p>

<p>One by one the rest were allowed to climb out of
the boat. They gathered upon a part of the field
that rose a full ten feet above the sea; and there
they began trying to get small pieces of ice to eat.
It was as salt as the sea itself, and they were disappointed,
spitting it out. Smith took a man along
with him and started for the berg. The boat was
left in charge of four men, who held her off the
floe.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, the whole crowd had managed
to get fresh-water ice. The second officer kept
them close to the boat and watched for any signs
of change in the weather. They were allowed to go
a short distance and get the stiffness from their
limbs by exercise.</p>

<p>"I am very tired and cold. Can I get back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the boat?" asked Miss Roberts, after she had been
stamping her feet upon the floe for half an hour.</p>

<p>Smith looked at her. The print of his hand was
plainly marked upon her face. He felt ashamed.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can go aboard," he said; and then, as
if in apology for what he had done, he explained:
"You must keep quiet in that boat, you know. You
must not try to walk about, for it endangers the
whole crowd. You understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll try and keep still, but my feet get so
cold and I grow so stiff."</p>

<p>"Well, you must forgive me for having used
you roughly. I had to do it. There was no time
for politeness in that panic." He came close to
her. His eyes held a light she feared greatly, and
she shrank back.</p>

<p>"I hope it is not a time now for politeness," she
said, with meaning.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't hurt you," said Smith.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said the girl.</p>

<p>Miss Billings asked if she could go aboard also.
Smith allowed her, and called the boat in.</p>

<p>The two girls climbed into the boat, and the
older women commented spiritedly upon the favors
of youth. Smith shut them up with an oath. The
woman with the three children huddled them back
aboard as the ice caused them to shiver with the
cold on their little feet. They had neglected to put
on their shoes. The women, for the most part, were
only half dressed, and few, if any, had on shoes.
They had rushed on deck at the first alarm, and the
time allowed for dressing was short. The ship had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
gone down within fifteen minutes from the first impact
with the berg.</p>

<p>Smith walked to and fro upon the ice for some
time. The sun shone for a few moments, but was
quickly hidden again in the haze.</p>

<p>A gentle breeze began to blow from the southward,
and the haze broke up a little. Smith began
to get nervous about the ice, and finally ordered
all his people back into the boat, where they huddled
and shivered, hungry but no longer thirsty.</p>

<p>During all these hours there had been no further
sign of the other boats. Smith knew that at least
ten of them had gone clear of the sinking ship. The
chief mate's boat was the one he was most interested
in at present. He wanted to see the man who had
indirectly caused the disaster; the man whom
Brownson was playing up for the berth of second
officer. The thing was a reality now since the tragedy.
Before it, he had looked upon the matter as
slight indeed.</p>

<p>The second mate headed his boat out and kept
clear of the drifting ice; but always under the lee
of the berg, which offered considerable shelter from
both wind and sea, which were rising. The danger
of floating ice was not great during daylight, and
he swung the small boat close and rode easily, keeping
her dry and clear of water. He dreaded the
plunging he must inevitably undergo in the open
ocean with that load of women.</p>

<p>With the increasing breeze, the haze lifted entirely
until the horizon showed clear all around.
There was no sign of the other boats. Smith knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
then that they had steered off to the southward to
avoid the ice. As the sea began to grow, the masses
of ice broke adrift with distinct and loud reports,
the plunging pieces from the higher parts making
considerable noise above the deepening roar of the
surge upon the base.</p>

<p>At three in the afternoon, Smith began to feel
nervous. The ice was breaking up fast, and immense
pieces were floating in the sea which bore
them toward him. They grew more and more dangerous
to the small craft, and the officer headed
away from the vicinity and sought the open at last.</p>

<p>By five that afternoon, when the light was fading,
he was riding a heavy sea, that grew rapidly
and rolled quickly, the combers breaking badly and
keeping two men busy bailing the boat. She made
water fast.</p>

<p>The night came on with all its terrors, and the
small boat was in great danger. Smith tried his
best to keep her headed to the sea, which was now
running high and strong. His men began to
weaken under the continuous strain; and by ten that
night they could no longer hold the boat's head to
the sea. She fell off once or twice, and nearly filled
when in the trough. There was little to do but
make a last effort to hold her. The steady second
officer came to his last resource.</p>

<p>There were five oars in the boat. Four of these
he lashed into a drag by fastening two of them in
the shape of a cross, and then lashing the other two
across the end of the cross. He had a spare line
of some length in the boat; and with this bent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the painter, he had a cable of at least twenty fathoms,
which he led over the bows and to the drag.
The drag was weighted with some chain that lay
forward. The fifth oar he kept aboard, and used it
himself for a sweep to hold her head as nearly as
possible behind the drag and to the sea.</p>

<p>He was tired, sore, and hungry, but he kept the
boat's head true for hours, and his people huddled
down in the bottom, and prayed or swore as the
humor took them. The children wept, and some of
the older women fainted and lay prone. These gave
no trouble. Some of the younger ones still insisted
on moving about, and brought the wrath of the
mate upon them in no uncertain manner. Smith
was making a fight for their lives, and would not
tolerate any hysteria. He smote all who disobeyed
with his usual impersonal and rough manner; but
the two girls were now too much cowed to give him
trouble. They lay in the boat's bottom and wept
and sobbed the night long, holding to each other,
while the boat tossed high in the air or fell far
down the slopes of ugly seas. And all the time the
water broke over her low gunwales as she sat well
down under her load of living freight.</p>

<p>It was about midnight when the old man, who
had been unruly from the first, sprang upon a
thwart and plunged over the side with a shrill
scream.</p>

<p>Smith saw him, and made, a pass to catch him
with the oar; but the old fellow drifted out of
reach. The second officer swung the boat as far as
possible toward him; but still he could not reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the figure that showed floating for a few moments
in the darkness. Then Miss Roberts, who was close
to the stern sheets, spoke up.</p>

<p>"Oh, the pity of it, the pity of that old man dying
like this! Will no one save him?" she cried.</p>

<p>Her companion sat up.</p>

<p>"There's no one aboard here who can do anything
but bully us women. If we had a man here,
we might save him. I would jump after him myself,
but I can't swim. It's horrible to see him
drown right alongside of us in this darkness."</p>

<p>Smith heard and smiled grimly. He was tired
out, sore, and almost exhausted, but he was full of
pluck and fight still. To drop the steering oar might
prove fatal if a comber struck the boat. He called
to the stroke oarsman who took the oar. Smith
took the stern line, gave a turn about a cork jacket
that lay upon the seat, and then over the side he
went, calling the men to haul him in when he gave
the word.</p>

<p>The affair had only taken a few moments, and
the form of the old fellow was hardly under the
surface. Smith floundered to him; but, being a poor
swimmer, as most sailors are, he was quite exhausted
when he finally grabbed him. Instead of
easing on the line, he hung dead upon it, hardly
able to keep his face out of the sea. The girls
watched him over the gunwales, but keeping their
places. Two men started to haul him in without
waiting for a signal; and they hove upon the line
with a right good will. It was old and dry-rotted,
as most lines in lifeboats are, and it parted.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Smith felt the slack, and knew what it meant.
The cork jacket held him above the surface, and he
looked at the boat which seemed so far away in the
darkness, but in reality was only a few fathoms.
Yet it was too far for him to make it again. It
meant his death, his ending.</p>

<p>He tried to swim, but the exertion of the day had
been too much. His efforts were weak and ill-directed,
and he floundered weakly about, drifting
farther away all the time.</p>

<p>The stroke oarsman called for another line.
There was none except that of the drag. It would
not do to haul it in. The boat was doing all she
could now to keep herself afloat, and to risk her
broadside in the sea might be fatal for all hands.</p>

<p>Miss Roberts begged some one to go to the officer's
assistance. Smith seemed to hear and understand.
He floundered with more vigor. There was
not a man among the boat's crew who dared to go
over the side in the night. There was nothing more
to do but watch and hope that the second mate
would finally make it. But he did not. He struggled
on for many minutes. They could see him now
and then fighting silently in the night. He still
seemed to hold the old man with one hand.</p>

<p>"It is dreadful&mdash;can no one do anything for
him?" begged Miss Roberts.</p>

<p>"I can't swim a stroke, lady," said the man at the
steering oar.</p>

<p>No one volunteered to go. Smith slowly drifted
off as the boat sagged back upon her drag. Then
he disappeared entirely in the darkness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>"The brute&mdash;I didn't think it was in him," said
Miss Billings, with feeling.</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way," said Miss Roberts. "Don't
talk that way of a man who did what he has done.
I forgive him with all my heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The morning dawned, and the sea rolled with less
vigor. The boat was still able to keep herself clear.
The white faces of the men told of the frantic endeavor.
The women were now nearly all too exhausted
to either care for anything or do anything.
They lay listless upon the boat's bottom, and she
made better weather for that fact. By nine o'clock
a steamer was heading for them; and within an
hour they were safe aboard and bound in for New
York. They arrived a few days later.</p>

<p>The chief mate's boat had kept her course to the
southward after leaving the berg&mdash;she had gone
ahead of Smith's. By midnight that night she was
almost dead ahead of the second officer's boat when
Smith jumped in to save the old man.</p>

<p>Daylight showed Wylie a dark speck on the horizon;
and at the same time he saw the smoke of the
approaching steamer. He had made bad weather of
it, also; but with more men and less women in his
craft he had kept to the oars, and, when it was very
bad, had run slowly before it for several hours.
This had brought him from many miles in advance
to but a few ahead of Smith's boat; and he was
rowing slowly ahead again by daylight. He sighted
her, and noticed there were no oars; but he saw the
man steering, and rightly guessed that they were
hanging onto a drag.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Mr. Roberts, the nephew of Captain Brownson,
sat close to the mate. He had relieved him several
times during the night. Large and powerful, he
was able to aid the chief mate very much.</p>

<p>"I think my sister is in that boat," he said as they
sighted her.</p>

<p>"It looks like the second officer's boat, all right,"
said Wylie.</p>

<p>They rowed straight for her as the smoke of the
steamer rose in the east. Before they came within
a mile, they saw that the steamer would reach them
before they could reach the boat. They then rowed
slowly, and watched, waiting.</p>

<p>"Something right ahead, sir," called a man forward.</p>

<p>Roberts looked over the side. He saw something
floating.</p>

<p>"Starboard, swing her over a little," he said to
the chief mate.</p>

<p>Roberts leaned over the side. He was nervous
at what he saw. It had the look of something he
dreaded. Then the object came drifting along, and
he reached for it. Long before he grasped it, he
saw it was the form of a man holding to a cork
jacket with one hand and the collar of a man's coat
with the other.</p>

<p>The old fellow floated high, and Smith's hand
was clenched with a death grip in his clothes. His
left hand was jammed through the life jacket, and
the fingers clutched the straps. His head lay face
upward, and his teeth showed bared from his gums.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>"Heavens! It's Smith himself!" exclaimed Roberts.
He hauled him aboard with the help of a man.</p>

<p>"It's poor Smith, all right," said Wylie sadly.
The life jacket told a tale too plainly. Wylie knew
what had happened.</p>

<p>"It's just as well he didn't come ashore. He was
guilty, all right," said Mr. Roberts. "A man who
wrecks a liner and kills hundreds of passengers
might just as well stay out here. Shall we leave
him?"</p>

<p>"Not if I know it," said Wylie, with sudden heat.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes they were picked up by the
steamer and were safe. The manager of the line
welcomed Mr. Roberts gladly when that gentleman
came to seek him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry we didn't have you that voyage, Mr.
Roberts," he said. "I don't like to say anything
against a dead man; but, of course, Smith was on
duty when she struck&mdash;that is all we know."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you'll want me to go into the
other ship, now, sir?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can report to Captain Wilson any time
this week. How is your sister? Did she recover
from the boat ride?"</p>

<p>"Well, in a way, but she's forever talking about
that blamed second mate, Smith, who seemed to
have a strange sort of influence over her while she
was with him in the boat. He struck her, too, the
dog! It's just as well he didn't come back," said
Roberts.</p>

<p>"Well, she'll get over that all right. Smith was
a rough sort of man; but as we knew him, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
a first-class sailor, a splendid navigator; and no one
seems able to explain how he ran the ship against
an iceberg during daylight. It's one of those things
we'll never find out. The truth, you know, is
mighty hard to fathom in marine disasters. It must
have been a terrible blow to Brownson to have to
kill himself, unable to face the shame for a mate's
offense&mdash;but Brownson was always a sensitive man,
a splendid fellow; and I suppose he would not go in
a boat after what Smith had done. Brownson was
captain, and might come under some criticism.
Some of the men say he shot himself after upbraiding
Smith for his crime."</p>

<p>"Yes. My sister tells me they had quite heated
words while the liner was sinking," said the new
second mate.</p>

<p>And so William Smith passed out. His name
was never mentioned in shipping circles without
reserve. But there are still some men who remember
him, who knew plain "Bill" Smith, the fighting
second officer of the liner that went to her end that
morning off the Grand Banks. And those who
knew Smith always think of that cork jacket. They
made no comment. They knew him. It is not
necessary.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE LIGHT AHEAD</h2></div>


<p>"Red light on starboard bow, sir," came the
hail from forward. The man was Jenson,
a "square-head" of more than usual intelligence
and of keen eyesight.</p>

<p>"All right," said the mate softly, with no concern.
He gazed steadily at a point two points off
the starboard bow, picked up the night glass, and
took a quick look. Then he left the pilot house
where he had been, and walked athwartships on the
bridge.</p>

<p>He was a young man. His eyes squinted a little
under the strain of night work and showed the
wrinkles at their corners. His hair was black and
curly, and his bronzed face, strong-lined and handsome,
was full of the strength and vigor of youth.
He had gone to sea at fifteen. He was now twenty-five
and a chief mate in a passenger ship, a first-class
navigator, a good seaman. And the company
liked him. He was a favorite, a young man rising
in the best ships. Five feet eight in his white canvas
shoes and white duck uniform, he looked short,
for he was very stout of limb; a powerful man who
had gained his strength by hard work in the forecastle
and upon the main deck of several windjam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>mers
whose records in the Cape trade were well
known to all shipping men.</p>

<p>It was the midwatch. Mr. James had been upon
the bridge about half an hour only. It was the
blackest part of the night, the time between one and
two, in the latitude north of Hatteras. James
rubbed his eyes once or twice, brushed his short
mustache from his mouth with his fingers, and felt
again for the night glass just within the pilot-house
window, which was open.</p>

<p>"How does she head?" he asked the helmsman
softly.</p>

<p>"West, two degrees north, sir," said the quartermaster
at the steam steering wheel.</p>

<p>James looked again, and, replacing the glass,
walked to the bridge rail and stopped.</p>

<p>The point far ahead to starboard was showing
plainly. It was the red light of some steamer whose
hull was still below the horizon. Her funnel tops
just showed like a black dot, darker than the surrounding
gloom. Her masthead light was very
bright, shining like a star of the first magnitude that
had just risen from a clear sky. He knew she was
a long way off. Not less than twelve miles separated
the vessels. There was plenty of time for a
change of course. He began to hum softly:</p>

<p>
"When the lights you see ahead,
Port your helm and show your red&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>"Yes," he muttered, "it's a good old saw&mdash;poetry
of the night. I wonder if <i>she</i> knows of the poetry
of&mdash;of&mdash;the sea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>His mind went back to the days ashore, the last
days he had spent upon the beach with her.</p>

<p>"And I have worked up to this for you," he had
told her with all the feeling he could muster, the
strong passion of a strong man asking for what he
desired most. "I have worked up to this for you,
just you."</p>

<p>The words rang in his ears. The scene was there
before him. The beautiful woman, the woman he
loved more than his life. He could tell her no more
than that&mdash;he had done all he had done just for
her, just to be able to call her his own.</p>

<p>The dead monotony of the life before him hung
like a black pall, heavy in the night. He saw all
the lonely years he must face, all the hard life of
the sailor, for she had simply laughed lightly,
looked him squarely in the eyes&mdash;and shook her
head.</p>

<p>"No," she had said gently. "No, you mustn't
think of it&mdash;I mean it&mdash;&mdash;" And he knew that
what he had done was as nothing to her, nothing
at all&mdash;what was a mate to a woman like that?</p>

<p>The steady vibration of the engines below made
the steel rigging shake. The low drone of the side
wash as the surf roared from the bows made a soft
murmur where it reached his ears. It made him
drowsy, dreamy, and sullen. He cared for nothing
now. What was a mate, after all? Any corner
groceryman was far better in the eyes of most
women. Perhaps he had been mistaken. Perhaps
the position he had ideals of was not much. Yes&mdash;that
was it; he had been mistaken. And he gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
steadily out into the dark future, and subconsciously
he saw a long, dreary life of toil and trouble, without
the woman he loved to relieve the dark solitude.</p>

<p>Before him rose the lights. The red was now
well up and rising fast. It had been but a flickering
spark at first, showing soon after the bright headlight
had risen. It was upon the port side of that
vessel's bridge and high above the sea. It was
electric, for no ordinary oil burner would show so
far with color. The ship must be a liner of size, and
must be going fast. Suddenly he saw a flash of
green. It was the starboard light of the approaching
ship. Then for an instant both side lights shone
brightly.</p>

<p>The vessel then was not crossing his bows, after
all. The green was her starboard light, and that
was the one she must show. It was all right then.
He would not change the course. If she swung
out, she must be coming almost head on now, for
her red had shone but two points off the bow, and
the converging courses must be drawing together.</p>

<p>All right then. If they crossed before the ships
met it was well and good. There would probably
be a mile or more to spare, and he was even now
crossing her course, for he saw her green light,
which showed him he was right ahead of her, and
his rate of speed would take him over in a few moments.
Then her green would be upon his right or
starboard side, showing that she was passing astern
of him. It was simple, plain as could be. He paid
little or no attention any longer.</p>

<p>And then suddenly the green light faded and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
red shone again. It caused the officer to stop in his
walk, which he had begun again to keep in action.</p>

<p>"Port your helm a little," he ordered as he realized
the positions.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir&mdash;port it is, sir," came the monotonous
response from the pilot-house window; and
the clanking of the steam gear sounded faintly upon
his ears.</p>

<p>The giant liner swung slowly to starboard, swung
just a little; and, as she did so, the loom of a monstrous
figure rose right ahead in the night. The
glare of the bright headlight shone close aboard.
The red of her port light was a dangerous glare;
and at a space to port flickered a moment the fatal
green of the starboard side light, flickered, and
then went out, shut off by the running board as the
vessel swung across the bows of the ship, where the
mate stood gazing at her.</p>

<p>"Hard aport," he yelled savagely.</p>

<p>"Hard aport, sir," came the response from the
wheel, and the voice showed more or less concern
now.</p>

<p>There was an instant of suspense, a moment of
silence, and the two giant shapes came close with
amazing speed. The liner swung to her port helm,
and her bows pointed clear of the light ahead. But
the speed was awful. Both going at twenty-five
knots an hour, making the closing speed nearly a
mile a minute, brought the giants too close to pass
clear.</p>

<p>There was a hoarse cry from forward. The
mate knew he was not going to clear, and the roar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of his siren tore the night's silence. Then the huge
fabrics came in collision. There was a gigantic
crash, a thundering shock, and a tearing, ripping
sound as steel tore steel to ribbons.</p>

<p>The shock made the rigging sing like a giant
harp under the strain, and the "ping" of parting
steel lines sounded in accompaniment to the tumultuous
crashing of wood and iron. The cries of men
came faintly through the uproar from forward, and
this was followed almost instantly by frantic shrieks
from aft as the effect of the shock was felt by the
women passengers.</p>

<p>The liner had failed to clear, and, swinging too
late to port, had cut slantingly into the other ship's
quarter and tore away the greater part of her stern.
Tearing, grinding, ripping, and snapping, the huge
shapes ground alongside for a few moments as
their headway took them along without reducing
speed. Too late the reversing engines, too late the
telegraph for all speed astern. The ships had come
in contact. The mate had run into another ship
that had shown him her red light to starboard.
There was no mistake about it. The cry of the seaman
on watch had been heard by fifty persons.</p>

<p>"Red light on the starboard bow, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It rang in the officer's ears. It sounded above the
terrible din of smashing steel and beams, and even
above the roar of the sirens telling of the death
wound that had been given a marine monster of
twenty-five thousand tons register.</p>

<p>The awful feeling of responsibility paralyzed the
mate. The terror of what he had done numbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
him; stunned him so that he stood there upon the
bridge like a man asleep. Fifteen hundred human
souls were sinking in that ship, which was now
drifting off to port in the night with their cries
sounding faintly through the blackness, even rising
to be heard through the roar of the steam. He
thought of it. It was ghastly. Fifteen hundred
souls; and he knew how badly he had wounded the
ship. He knew the terrific power of the blow he
had delivered&mdash;shearing off the after part of that
vessel and letting in the sea clear to the midship
bulkhead. There was no chance for her to float.
The wound was too deadly. It was as bad as though
he had rammed her with a battleship's ram.</p>

<p>The half-dressed form of the captain rushed to
him&mdash;his captain.</p>

<p>"What happened?" he whispered hoarsely. He
seemed to be afraid to ask the question loudly.
"Great Heaven, did you hit her?"</p>

<p>The mate stood gazing at the huge shadow, and
his tongue refused to answer the question. Then
the voice beside him seemed to gain its power. It
roared out:</p>

<p>"Bulkheads, there&mdash;close them, quick!" And the
automatic device, worked from the pilot house, was
pulled savagely.</p>

<p>The captain rushed into the pilot house. The
man at the wheel who had left it to throw the lever
to close the bulkheads sprang back to his post.</p>

<p>"How'd you do it?" asked the master again, in a
low voice full of passion and strained to the utmost.
"How'd you strike&mdash;don't you know you killed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
least five hundred men? You murdering brute&mdash;you
were asleep." Then he raised his voice again,
and bawled down through the tube to MacDougal,
the chief engineer.</p>

<p>"How is she&mdash;quick&mdash;get the pumps going&mdash;collision&mdash;keep
the firemen cool, and for God's sake
don't let them panic&mdash;keep them at their posts until
we see what's up. We've run down the express
steamer <i>Blue Star</i>, of the Royal Dutch Line&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The master turned to the pilot house again and
looked out of the window. His chief officer was
still standing where he had left him.</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, Mr. James, what's the matter
with you to-night?" he broke out wildly, in passionate
tones, almost sobbing. "It's all hands&mdash;get
'em out quick!"</p>

<p>He was a strange creature standing there in his
undershirt and drawers, with his long gray beard
streaming down across his breast. The man at the
wheel even looked at him for a moment, but did
not smile. It was tragedy, not comedy.</p>

<p>"Is she full speed astern?" asked the master
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, full speed astern, sir," said the man.
His face was white, and his hands shook a little
while he held the spokes of the wheel. There was
death for many that night, and he knew it. It
would be hard to tell who would survive in the rush
that was sure to come if the ship went down. Yet
his seamanship told him that much was to be hoped
from the forward bulkhead. It would hold her up
if it could stand the strain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>In two minutes there was a rush of hundreds of
feet upon the decks below the flying bridge. The
second officer came up half naked, dressed in shirt
and trousers, without shoes or stockings. He was
a powerful man and short, with a tremendous voice,
a real Yankee bos'n voice; and he roared out orders
for the men, who jumped to their stations automatically.</p>

<p>The captain came again to the bridge and took
command. He yelled to the boat crews below, and
strove to quiet the crowding passengers who pushed
and fought about the boats in spite of the after
guard and seamen.</p>

<p>"Get down there and wade into that mess, Wilson,"
said the master to the second officer; and he
jumped down and went bawling through the press,
pushing and pulling, striking here and there a refractory
passenger who would insist upon trying to
fill the small boats.</p>

<p>"There is no danger&mdash;no danger whatever,"
roared the captain again and again from the bridge.
The petty officers took up the cry, and gradually the
press about the starboard lifeboats grew less. The
boats upon the port side had been all carried away
or smashed to bits. Ten boats were left.</p>

<p>A man rushed up the bridge steps coming from
aft.</p>

<p>"She's sinking, sir," he panted, pointing to the
dim shadow of the rammed ship drifting astern.
The steady roar of her siren told of the danger, and
seemed to be a resonant cry for help.</p>

<p>The master gazed aft. Then he rushed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
pilot-house window and took up the night glass
hanging there. He looked hard at the ship now lying
astern and riding with her bows high in the air.
The man was right. She was rapidly going down.
Ten minutes at the most would tell the whole story.</p>

<p>"Get the starboard boats out, Mr. James," called
the captain in an even tone, "and let no one but the
crews in them. The first man who attempts to get
in will be shot. Go to the vessel and bring back all
you can&mdash;quick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the form there had vanished before he had
finished speaking. The chief officer had awakened
at last from his stupor. His responsibility came
back to him with a rush of feeling. But an instant
before he had faced the end. He had decided to kill
himself at once, and was just about to go to his
room for his gun. He was too ashamed to face the
ordeal, the ordeal of the officer who has run down
a ship in a clear night. There had been literally no
excuse for him. He could not plead ignorance of
the laws; his license as officer made that impossible.
He knew what to do when raising a light to starboard
when that light was red. The rules were
plainly written. Every common waterman knew
them by heart. He had disobeyed them by some
mischance, some mistake he could not exactly define;
but he knew that under it all was that dull,
sullen apathy from a wrong, or fancied wrong, that
had caused him to be negligent.</p>

<p>He would not go upon the witness stand and say
that, because a woman did not love him, he had allowed
his ship to ram a liner with fifteen hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
souls aboard her in a clear night. No! Death was
a hundred, a thousand times better than such ignominy,
such a miserable, cowardly sort of excuse.
He would blow his brains out just as soon as he saw
the finish, just as soon as he knew his vessel would
float. Then came the captain's voice of command:</p>

<p>"Get out the starboard boats and save all you
can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yes, it was his duty; his above all others. He
was at number one boat before the master had finished
his orders.</p>

<p>Six good men were at their stations. The falls
were run taut, the boat shoved clear, and down she
went with a rush into the sea. Nine others followed
within a minute, and ten boats pulled away
into the darkness astern, where the roar of the siren
still sounded loud and resonant&mdash;a wild, terrible
cry of death and destruction.</p>

<p>James met a boat coming toward him before he
reached the ship. She was full. Sixty-two men
and women filled her, and she just floated, and that
was all, her gunwales awash in the smooth sea. The
swell lifted her, and she rose high above him, a dark
object against the sky. Then she sank slowly down
into the trough, and disappeared behind the hill of
water that ran smoothly from the northeast in long,
heaving seas.</p>

<p>The night was still fine, and the wind almost
nothing at all. The banks of vapor rising in the
east told of a change; but the change was not yet.
James noticed the weather mechanically, as a good
seaman does, from a small boat when at sea at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
night; but he was thinking of the huge shadow
which now drew close aboard.</p>

<p>As the boat came under the port side, he could
see the passengers crowding the rail in the waist,
where the lifeboats were being filled and sent away
as fast as men could work them. Seven boats were
alongside full of human beings. Two more were
being lowered. Three came from under the stern
as he drew alongside.</p>

<p>There was a mass of people still to be taken off.
He saw at a glance that the liner had twenty large
lifeboats for her complement. One was smashed.
There was every reason to believe she would send
out nineteen with at least a thousand people in them.
There would be several hundred more to take besides
these. The life rafts might do it, but he knew
the danger of life rafts in the furious struggle in a
sinking ship.</p>

<p>The thing would be to save the passengers with
his own boats. This he might do if the ship floated
long enough. She was sinking fast, as he could see
by her rising bows. She was probably even now
hanging solely by her midship bulkhead, and that
would most likely be badly smashed by the collision,
for he had struck the ship far enough forward
to do it damage, although his vessel had only
cut into her well aft. The blow had been slanting.
A little more time, perhaps a few seconds, and the
ships would have swung clear.</p>

<p>He came alongside and hailed the deck.</p>

<p>"Send them down lively&mdash;come along now,
quick!" he called up in his natural voice. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the first time since the collision he had spoken. It
sounded strange to hear his own tones coming natural
again.</p>

<p>In a few moments he was crowding and seating
the women and children in his boat. Then came the
men from everywhere. They crowded down the falls,
jumped into the sea, and swam alongside, begging
to be hauled aboard, or climbed over the high gunwales
themselves. One powerful young man,
stripped to the waist, dived clean from the hurricane
deck, and almost instantly rose alongside. Then he
swung himself into the boat, and stood amidships
hauling others in until the craft settled down to
her bearings and the men at the oars could hardly
row.</p>

<p>"Shove off&mdash;give way," ordered James.</p>

<p>The boat started back slowly, the men rowing
gingerly, poking and striking the passengers in the
backs with the oars until the crowd settled itself.
Then she went along slowly toward the ship, and
the women in her prayed, the men swore, and the
children wept and sobbed. And all the time the fact
that he was the cause of it all impressed James
queerly. He could not understand it, could not
quite see why he had done it, and yet he knew he
had. One man spoke to the athlete who had dived.</p>

<p>"They should burn a man who would sink a ship
like this on a clear night; they should burn him to a
stake&mdash;the drunken, cowardly scoundrel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And James sat there with the tiller ropes in his
hand; sat silent, thoughtful, and knew in his heart
the man had spoken the truth. If he could only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sure of the passengers&mdash;he would not give them a
chance to say anything more. His boat came alongside
his own ship. The crowd above cheered him&mdash;they
did not know&mdash;he was a hero to them, the first
boat with the rescued. How quickly they would
change that cheer when they learned the truth! He
almost smiled. His set face, strong-lined, bronzed,
and virile, turned away from the people in the boat.
He gave orders in the usual tone. The passengers
were quickly passed aboard. Then he started back
for another load.</p>

<p>By this time the sides of his ship were crowded
with boats. She was taking aboard over a thousand
people, and the sea was still smooth.</p>

<p>The swell heaved higher as the small boat went
back toward the sinking steamer. James noticed it.
The sky to the eastward was dark with a bank of
vapor. The air had the feeling of a northeaster.
It was coming along, and there was plenty of time,
for it would come slowly. The last of the passengers
would be either sunk or aboard his own
ship before the breeze rose to a dangerous extent.</p>

<p>The men rowed quickly. They were anxious.
The horror of the whole thing had fallen upon
them like a pall; but they strove mightily to do their
share. James found his boat to be the last to reach
the sinking ship.</p>

<p>The liner was well down now by the stern and
her deck was awash aft. She rose higher and
higher as he gazed at her, her decks slanting, sloping,
and she rolled loggily in the growing swell.
Her siren stopped. A dull, muffled roar from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
sea, a smothered explosion told of the end of the
boilers. She would go in a moment. The passengers
were clinging, grabbing to anything to hold on.
The deck slanted so dangerously that many were
slid off into the sea where they plunged, some silently
and hopelessly, others screaming wildly with
the terror of sudden death.</p>

<p>James watched them. He saw many die, saw
many go to their end. Others swam; and he strove
to pick them up, forgetting himself in the struggle.</p>

<p>He picked up sixteen in this manner, steering for
them as they swam about in the night calling for
help. The last one was a girl, a beautiful girl of
twenty or less. He hauled her into the boat.</p>

<p>A sudden, wild yelling caused him to look. The
sinking liner stood upon end, her forefoot clear of
the sea. She swung loggily to and fro for a moment,
settling as she did so. Then, with a rush, she
plunged stern first to the bottom, the crash of her
bursting decks as the air blew out being the last
sound he heard.</p>

<p>The ship was very close to him. Her swing as
she foundered brought her closer. The vortex
sucked his boat toward her, drew the craft with a
mighty pull. A spar, twisting, whirling in the
swirl, struck the boat, and instantly she was a
wreck, capsized, engulfed in the mighty hole the
sinking liner made in the sea with her last plunge.</p>

<p>James found himself smothered, drowning,
drawn downward by a great force he could not
fight against. The whole ocean seemed to pull down
upon him and crush him into its black depths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>The whole thing took such a small space of time,
he hardly realized his position. The utter blackness,
the salt water in his eyes and mouth, all paralyzed
his mind for a few moments. Then he
thought of his end. It was just as well. He was
drowning, going to the bottom. He must soon go,
anyhow; he could not face those wrecked passengers;
and with the thought came a grim peacefulness,
a satisfaction that the fight was all over. He
could now rest at last.</p>

<p>But nature within him was very strong. He was
a powerful man. When he gave up the struggle,
his natural buoyancy lifted him to the surface of the
sea. He came up, his head appearing in the air,
and he breathed again in spite of himself. Then
the old, old fighting spirit, the desire to survive
which is so strong within the breast of every young
animal, took charge. No, he would not go down
yet. He must see the finish, the end of things in
which he was concerned.</p>

<p>He swam about aimlessly. The swell heaved him
high up, dropped him far down; and he noticed that
now the sea was running, the small combers rising
before a stiff breeze. These burst upon his face
and head and smothered him a little. He turned
his back to them, and swam on, on, and still on into
the darkness.</p>

<p>He saw nothing. The ship, the boats had all
gone. Once he was about to cry for help; but the
thought was horrible, distasteful to the last degree.
He had no right to call for help. He would not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
But he swam and tried to see something to get
upon.</p>

<p>Something struck him heavily upon the head.
Stars swam before his eyes. He reached upward
with his hands, and they met a solid substance.
Then he sank slowly down, down&mdash;and the blackness
came upon him.</p>

<p>The object that had hit him was a small boat. In
it were a man and a girl, the girl James himself had
picked up from the sea a short time before. The
man was a seaman, and he heard the boat strike.
He reached over the side, caught the glimpse of a
human form as it struck the boat's side and sank.</p>

<p>The seaman took up the boat hook and was about
to poke the body away. He was sick of dead men,
sick of seeing corpses floating about. He had met
half a dozen already that night. But this one
seemed to move, and the hook caught in his clothes.
He pulled the body up, and saw the man was not
dead, but dazed, moving feebly in a drunken way.
Then he pulled James into the boat.</p>

<p>James regained his senses after half an hour; and
during that time the boat ran before a stiff squall
of wind and rain that swept it along before it into
the darkness. The seaman steered with an oar, and
kept the boat's head before the wind. The mate
opened his eyes, and in the gray of the early dawn
he saw a man he did not know, a seaman from the
sunken liner, steering the boat calmly before the
gale that was now coming fast with the rising sun.
Near him in the bottom of the boat lay the girl huddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
up and moaning with cold and fright, and
fatigue.</p>

<p>James arose and staggered aft.</p>

<p>"How'd I get here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I pulled you in, sir," said the sailor. "Are you
from the ship that sank us?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm the mate, the chief officer."</p>

<p>"Well, if I'd 'a' know'd it, I mightn't have taken
the trouble," said the seaman.</p>

<p>James said nothing. There was nothing for him
to say. He knew the sailor was right. He knew
the officers of his ship were men to scorn, to hate&mdash;but
he would not say it was himself alone who had
done the terrible deed. Something stopped him. It
might have been sheer shame&mdash;or fear. He looked
at the girl. Then he went to her and raised her,
placing her upon a seat and trying to cheer her up.</p>

<p>"We'll be picked up soon&mdash;don't worry about it.
Our ship will stand by and hunt for all the missing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm dreadfully cold," said the girl, with
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"Put my coat on, then," said James; and he took
off his soaked coat and made her put it on.</p>

<p>The man grinned in derision.</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "who was on watch when you hit
us?"</p>

<p>James took no notice. He would not answer the
question. Then the girl spoke up.</p>

<p>"Yes, whose fault was it? You belong to the
other ship, you'll know all about it. They ought
to hang the man who is responsible for this awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
thing&mdash;my poor mother and father&mdash;oh&mdash;&mdash;" And
she broke into a sob.</p>

<p>The man at the steering oar smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, that's right, they sure ought to hang
the officer who runs down a liner on a clear night
when he's bound to see the lights plainly. I don't
make no excuses for him&mdash;it's more'n murder."</p>

<p>"You were on watch, on duty&mdash;you are dressed?"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, I knowed it when I first seen you," snarled
the seaman. "I reckon you're the man who did it&mdash;what
was the matter? Couldn't you keep awake,
or what?" The tone was a sneer, an insult, yet the
sailor did wish to find out how so unusual a thing
could happen as the running down of a ship on a
clear night when her lights could be seen fifteen
miles or more.</p>

<p>James tried to defend himself. It was instinctive.
The contempt of the sailor was too much. On other
occasions, he never allowed the slightest insolence
from the men of his own vessel. But now the officer
was numb, paralyzed. He was guilty&mdash;and he
knew it.</p>

<p>For hours they sat now in silence, the seaman
holding the boat steady before the northeaster,
which grew in power until by nine in the morning it
was blowing a furious gale, and the sea was running
strongly with sweeping combers. There was
nothing to do but keep the boat before it. To try
to head any other way meant to risk her filling from
a bursting sea. The exertion of steering was great.
The seaman, with set face, held onto the oar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
James could see the sweat start under the constant
strain, but he said nothing&mdash;he waited.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take her, sir&mdash;a while&mdash;I'm getting
played out," panted the man.</p>

<p>"All right," said James, "give her to me&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took the oar during the backward slant as she
dropped down the side of the sea that passed under
her. He was ready for the rush as she rose and
shot forward again upon the breaking crest of the
following hill. The exercise did him good. It
made him think clearly, it took his mind from the
hopelessness of his life.</p>

<p>All that day the two men took turns keeping the
small boat before the sea; and they ran to the southward
a full half hundred miles before the gale let
up. Both were too exhausted to talk, too thirsty to
even speak&mdash;and there was neither water nor food
in the boat. Her ration of biscuit and water had
been lost when she had been drawn down by the
sinking liner.</p>

<p>The sailor had righted the boat after great effort,
aided by the sea; and owing to the smoothness of
the swell at the time he had managed to get her
clear of water. Then he had picked up the girl
who had been floating about, swimming and holding
onto fragments of wreckage since James' boat
had gone under.</p>

<p>The mate noticed that, although the girl had not
spoken to him again after knowing he had caused
the disaster, she still wore his coat. He studied the
matter, the inconsistency of women, and he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
it strange. The sun shone for a moment before it
set that evening; and in the glowing light James
gazed steadily at the woman. She was very beautiful.
She had not made a complaint since the
morning. The sea was still running high, although
the wind was going down with the sun, yet the girl
had not been seasick, nor had she shown any suffering.</p>

<p>"How do you feel now?" he whispered, as he
waited his turn at the oar.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, thank you. Do you think we will
get picked up?" she said.</p>

<p>"We'll be picked up to-morrow&mdash;sure," said the
officer. "We are now right in the track of the West
India ships, and will sight something by daylight
when we can set a signal. Are you very thirsty?"</p>

<p>"Tell me first, how did this accident occur? Were
you really asleep, or just what? I can stand the
thirst, and I'm warm enough now. This water is
like milk in comparison with the air, it's so warm."</p>

<p>"We are in the Stream," said James; "the Gulf
Stream, and that is about eighty along here&mdash;it's
better than freezing in the high latitudes."</p>

<p>"You haven't answered my question," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't remember what it was. I
must have lost my head&mdash;been asleep&mdash;or something&mdash;yes,
I was on duty, on watch&mdash;it was my fault entirely.
I saw your ship, saw her red light to starboard&mdash;the
right, you know. She had the right of
way under the rules. I intended to swing off, waited
a few minutes to see her better&mdash;then her green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
light showed&mdash;and&mdash;then it was too late. I went
hard aport, did my best&mdash;but hit her&mdash;we were going
very fast&mdash;both ships were going twenty-five
knots&mdash;making the approaching speed fifty miles
an hour&mdash;nearly a mile a minute&mdash;I must have lost
my head just a moment&mdash;maybe I was dreaming&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you are not to blame," said the girl, placing
her hand in his. "You have told me the truth,
a straight story&mdash;but yet I don't see how it all happened.
I'm not a sailor, anyhow; perhaps I couldn't
understand. But I feel you didn't do it on purpose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," whispered James. "How could a man
do a thing like that on purpose?" He could not tell
her the truth. He was ashamed to mention a
woman, to say he was sullen, depressed, stupefied
at the loss of a love he bore a woman.</p>

<p>He took his place at the oar for the last time that
night. The sea was no longer dangerous. They
spoke of rigging a drag with the oar and thwarts,
making a drag by the aid of the painter or line,
which still was fast to her forward. They had
finished this before dark, and then they lay down,
exhausted. The girl stood watch. In the dim dawn
the girl gave out. She had stood watch all night,
and she was exhausted.</p>

<p>"I understand," she muttered to herself, "this
poor fellow, this officer was tired out&mdash;he slept&mdash;I
don't blame him at all, it was not his fault."</p>

<p>The sun shone upon the three sleeping, the boat
riding safely and dry to the drag made of the oar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and thwarts. James aroused himself first, awakening
dimly with the warmth of the sun. He sat
up. The two others slept on. The girl was breathing
loudly, almost panting, and her parted lips were
blue. Yet she was beautiful. James knew it. She
was exhausted, and help must come soon for her.</p>

<p>He sat and gazed at the horizon, and when the
sea lifted the boat, he stared hard all around to see
if anything showed above the rim. Hours passed
in this fashion. The girl moaned in her sleep. The
sailor shifted uneasily, and grunted, snored, and
murmured incoherently. They were all very thirsty.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock in the morning that
James saw something to the northward. It was
just a speck, just a tiny dot on the rim of sea; but
he knew it was a ship of some kind, a vessel passing.
The minutes dragged, and he was about to
rouse the sailor to get him to help watch. Then he
remembered how the fellow had striven so manfully
the day before when they rode out the gale. No, he
would let them sleep.</p>

<p>By noon, the vessel was close aboard and coming
slowly with the wind upon her port beam. She
was a schooner bound south. James could see the
lumber on her decks. Her three masts swung to
and fro in the swell, and she made bad weather of
the sluggish sea. The foam showed white under
her forefoot, and told of the speed being at least a
few knots an hour. James called the sailor.</p>

<p>"Get up&mdash;turn out&mdash;there's a schooner alongside,"
he said. The man moved slightly, and slept
on. James shook him roughly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>"Lemme alone," muttered the seaman.</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy!" yelled the mate as the schooner
came within a quarter of a mile and headed almost
straight for them. He stood up and waved his
arms. Nothing came of it. The girl awoke. She
sat up and realized the position. In a moment she
had taken off her skirt and handed it to the mate.
He waved it wildly; and his yelling finally awoke
the exhausted seaman. The man stood up and bawled
loudly. Then he washed his mouth with salt water,
and yelled again and again. James swung the skirt.
The girl prayed audibly.</p>

<p>The schooner stood right along on her course.
She had not noticed the boat. Passing a few hundred
fathoms from them caused all three to become
frantic. The men bawled, cursed, and begged the
schooner to take them in.</p>

<p>The captain of the vessel, coming on deck, happened
to look in their direction. He spoke to the
man at the wheel, who for the first time seemed to
take his eyes from the compass card. Then, taking
his glass, the captain saw that three living souls
were in the small boat. The next instant he was
bawling orders, and the schooner hauled her wind
and came slatting into the breeze.</p>

<p>Six men appeared on her deck. James saw them
working to get the small boat clear from her stern
davits. Then they seemed to realize that this was
unnecessary, and the schooner, flattening in her
sheets, worked up to them slowly, rising and falling
into the high swell. She stood across to wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ward,
and then came about, easing off her sheets
and drifting slowly down upon the boat.</p>

<p>She drew close aboard.</p>

<p>"Catch a line," yelled the captain from her deck.</p>

<p>James waved his hand in reply, and a heaving
line flaked out and fell across the boat's gunwales.</p>

<p>In another moment they were being hauled
aboard.</p>

<p>Explanations came at once. The master of the
schooner was bound for South America.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'll put you all aboard the first homeward-bound
ship I fall in with," said he.</p>

<p>"But you surely will put us ashore at once," said
the girl, after she had drunk tea and changed her
clothes. They were eating gingerly of ship's food
and drinking water ravenously.</p>

<p>"That I cannot do, miss," said the captain. "I'm
bound to Valparaiso with cargo, and I must take it
there."</p>

<p>"But we will pay you to take us ashore&mdash;pay you
anything, for I am very rich," said the girl.</p>

<p>The master smiled sadly. The effects of the forty
hours in the open boat were evidently having their
effect upon the young woman.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you go below, and the steward
will give you all you want to eat, and your clothes
will be dry enough to put on again before night.
We might fall in with a ship bound north any time
now. Then you'll have a chance."</p>

<p>James knew the man was within his rights, of
course. He was glad to be in the schooner. The
sailor didn't seem to mind where he went. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
ship was very much like another to him. The consul
would be bound to ship him home, anyway. The
girl was given a stateroom in the after cabin; and
she soon slept the sleep of the exhausted.</p>

<p>The mate stayed on deck. The whole thing had
a strange look to him. He had decided to kill himself.
He dared not go back to the States, anyhow,
to face the charges that would be made against him.
He might slip overboard any night on the run down,
and no one would be the wiser.</p>

<p>The fact that the schooner was bound to South
America seemed to give him a respite. There was
no hurry to commit the desperate act that he felt
he must, in all honor and decency, do. He might
live a month at least before dying.</p>

<p>After the awful struggle through the gale and
shipwreck, he felt a desire to live more than before.
The whole affair was more distant, almost effaced.
And now he was not going back, anyhow.</p>

<p>The captain asked him few questions regarding
his wreck, seeming to feel a certain delicacy about
it. The day passed, and the next and the next, and
no ship was sighted going north. They were now
drawing out of the track of vessels, and a strange
hope arose with the mate that they would not meet
one.</p>

<p>The girl sat with him often, and they talked of
other things than shipwreck. She was beautiful&mdash;there
was no question about it. The glow of returning
strength made her more lovely. James
found himself wondering at her. She had been the
only human being so far that would condescend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
speak to him without contempt. He was lonely,
very lonely, and the girl seemed to feel he needed
some one to cheer him up. She did not realize his
weakness. He was very strong to her; a strong man
who had suffered from an accident, due, perhaps,
to his carelessness, but not to criminal negligence.
But he knew, he knew, and could not tell.</p>

<p>The days passed, and the terror of the thing he
had in his mind began to fade slightly. He knew
he must die. The sailor, his shipmate who had been
picked up with him, had told every one in the
schooner that he, James, was on watch and was
responsible for a terrible disaster, the death of a
great number of persons. James saw it in their
looks. He knew he would never get a ship again,
never hold a place among white men. Yes, he
must die.</p>

<p>It gave him a sort of grim satisfaction to feel
that he was just to live a certain length of time,
that he would cut that short at the last moment.
He wondered how a prisoner felt when the sentence
of death was pronounced upon him. He had pronounced
it upon himself. It was a genuine relief,
for the vision of those terror-stricken, drowning
passengers was always with him night and day, except
when he was in a dreamless sleep. That sleep
seemed to be portentous of what he would face.</p>

<p>The days turned to weeks and the weeks to
months. The voyage was long and the winds light.
They were ninety days to the latitude of the Falklands
when they struck a furious "williwaw" from
the hills of Patagonia. The schooner was in a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
fix. She was lightly manned; and, in spite of the
addition of James and the seaman from the wreck,
she held her canvas too long.</p>

<p>The struggle was short but terrific. The fore-topsail
blew away and saved the mast; but the main
held, and the topmast buckled and finally went by
the board. The headsails had been lowered, but
they blew out from the gaskets, and the jibboom
snapped short off under the tremendous threshing
of flying canvas. The maintopmast, hanging by the
backstays, fell across the triatic stay, and the steel
of the backstays cut into the spring until it finally
parted under the jerks, and the mizzen was left to
stand alone. It went by the board, and the great
mast, snapping short at the partners, went over the
side, and smashed and banged there at each heave
of the ship.</p>

<p>There was desperate work to do to save the vessel.
Her master did wonders and showed his skill;
but the most dangerous and deadly task of going to
leeward to cut adrift the lanyards was left to James.
No one else would go.</p>

<p>James was a powerful man, and had won his way
to an officer's berth by endeavor, not by nepotism.
His hope was that he might be killed in the struggle.
He dared anything, tried to do the impossible&mdash;and
did it. How he succeeded in clearing away the
wreck of that mast remains a mystery to those who
watched him. He was almost dead when dragged
back and the schooner floated clear.</p>

<p>The girl had seen the whole affair from the glass
of the companionway. She had held her breath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
almost fainted again and again at the sight of
James in that fight for life. To her it was simply
grand, tremendous&mdash;she had never been touched by
a man's heroism before.</p>

<p>When it was all over and the schooner, dismantled
and storm-driven, lay riding down the giant seas
that swept around the Horn in the Pacific Antarctic
Drift, she watched over and attended the officer as
he lay in his bunk with a broken arm, a cut across
the head, and the toes of one foot gone. She knew
that there was something behind the will to do as
James had done. But she could not fathom it, could
not tell why he was unresponsive. He lay silent
mostly, and seldom looked at her. Yet he was sane
in his conversation, not delirious in any way. It
worried her. It caused that peculiar thing that is
in every woman to make the man she admires responsive.
And the more she showed her feelings,
the less he seemed to care. It ended the way it
usually does under such conditions. She fairly worshiped
him.</p>

<p>After that storm the weather grew very calm.
The dark ocean seemed to be at rest for a spell.
The schooner was now to the south'ard of the Falklands,
and the captain decided that he would not
venture around the Horn in the desperate condition
he was in. Stanley Harbor was under his lee, and
he bore away for it. Then, with the perversity of
the southern zone, the wind hauled to the eastward
and blew steadily for a week; blew right in their
faces.</p>

<p>James came on deck before they were within a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
hundred miles of the land. He sat about in the
cold of the evening wrapped up in rugs, and the
girl waited upon him, brought him anything he
wished. In the long hours of daylight&mdash;for it was
light enough to read until midnight&mdash;they sat near
the taffrail. The captain said nothing; he would
not notice. He liked the man who had saved his
ship. The girl was sympathetic, and James often
held her hand. She did not attempt to withdraw it.</p>

<p>But he would not tell her he cared for her. That
was absurd. He had already sacrificed his life. He
was as good as dead. Yet he wondered at the passion
that had brought him into such desperate
trouble and had caused so much ruin and death.
He pondered silently, and now often watched the
girl furtively.</p>

<p>Into the beautiful harbor, the great fiord of Port
Stanley, they came, the schooner making fairly good
way in spite of her crippled condition. Her arrival
was greeted with joyous acclaim by the land sharks,
who smelled the wound and saw the damage. They
would make a good haul. Ships didn't come often&mdash;but
when they did, well, they paid.</p>

<p>The governor was notified of the arrival. He
was told everything but the relation of the passengers
to the ships to which they originally belonged.
The master was generous; and, besides, it
was not America they were now in. It was an outlying
foreign colony at the edge of the world, a
place where one seldom went or heard from. They
might go ashore if they wished. The seaman asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to remain aboard. He was allowed to do so, and
consequently did not go ashore and talk too much.</p>

<p>James passed that last night in high spirits. He
was going out on his last voyage. He was going
to die, going to leave the woman who he knew
loved him, who had been so sympathetic, so lovable.
They were on deck a long time that evening, and
the captain, being wise and old enough to understand,
did not molest them.</p>

<p>"Good night," she said finally. "Good night. I'll
see you to-morrow before we go ashore. We can
take the ship across to the straits, and meet the regular
liner as she comes through from Punta Arenas.
We'll be home again in a few weeks."</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said simply. That was all. She
went below.</p>

<p>Shortly after four bells&mdash;two o'clock in the morning&mdash;James,
with set face and grim resolution, stole
on deck. He gazed up at the Southern Cross for a
few moments, at the beautiful constellation that he
would see for the last time; then at the grim, barren
hills back of the settlement.</p>

<p>It was a farewell look, his farewell to things in
this world. He was determined not to be disgraced.
He would die like a man, as he could no longer live
like one.</p>

<p>Then he dropped softly over the side, and sank
down&mdash;down into the quiet waters of Stanley
Harbor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The instinct of woman is often more certain than
her reason. The girl had noticed something strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in the man's behavior. She had woman's instinct
to divine its cause. She had not gone to bed
that night, but waited to see just what might
happen to the man who owned her very soul. She
had not realized before that she loved this officer,
this man who had confessed partly to his disgrace.
The realization awakened her wits. She would see
what he meant.</p>

<p>At the slight splash, she was on deck in an instant.
Her first thought was to call for help. Then
she knew to do so was to call for an explanation;
and she realized the disgrace that would follow instantly
upon the explanation. She seized a life buoy
always hanging upon the taffrail, and with it
dropped over the side.</p>

<p>She swam silently toward a spot that showed disturbed
water rapidly drifting astern with the tide.
Within a minute she had reached the form of James,
who had not placed enough weights in his clothes
to insure quick sinking. He was lying silently upon
his back, waiting&mdash;waiting for the end that must
come shortly.</p>

<p>"Swim with me," she pleaded. "You must&mdash;come
with me&mdash;we'll swim ashore together."</p>

<p>Before the morning dawned, the pair were upon
the beach, several miles distant from the schooner.
James saw he was doomed to life. He could not even
die. Then the beauty of the woman, the sympathy,
the love he could not deny, had its way with him,
and they decided to vanish into the country, to disappear
together.</p>

<p>This might or might not have been hard to do in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the islands where every one is well known. But it
happened that Captain Black, of the whaling station
situated near the entrance of the fiord, was on deck
that morning. He saw an amazing thing, a woman
and a man swimming together, and finally making
the land near the point.</p>

<p>Calling a couple of men, he started for them in
his whaleboat, and caught up with them before they
had gone more than a few fathoms from the shore.
They were chilled through, cold and exhausted. He
took them aboard the whaling steamer, and soon
saw that he had a seaman of parts in Mr. James.
Men were hard to get. All of his crews were convicts
or ticket-of-leave men; and the addition of a
man even with a wife was something to be taken
advantage of.</p>

<p>He took James aside and asked him a few questions.
He was satisfied that he would not get into
trouble by giving the officer a billet; and he forthwith
made him one of the company in charge of a
small boat. The affair would be kept secret, and
the governor would be told nothing. He probably
would not ask too many questions, anyhow.</p>

<p>"I shall ship you both to the north'ard station,
fifty miles up the coast. You can have a shack
there&mdash;plenty of peat for fires and good grub&mdash;I'll
inspect you once a month. Johnson will be in
charge of the station. You can take this letter to
him. Your wife can go with you if you wish."</p>

<p>James looked at the girl. She nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Is there a priest about here?" asked James.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?" asked Black.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>"Well, if you'll kindly send for him, he can marry
us before we start."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Back of the northward station, on the ramp that
rises sheer back from the beach like a table-land,
there are a few cottages. These are occupied by the
crews of the whaling station and their families. In
one of them is a handsome woman with two little
tots&mdash;happy-faced and smiling she is. But she
seems a bit out of place in her surroundings. Mrs.
James Smith they call her, and she is apparently
very happy, very happy indeed, in spite of it all.</p>

<p>James Smith is the best gun pointer in the fleet,
the best harpooner with the gun-firing harpoon. He
is a sober, quiet, steady man, who has nothing now
of the ship's officer about him. He never talks of
wrecks. If some one starts a conversation regarding
them&mdash;and they are much hoped for in the
Falklands&mdash;he goes away.</p>

<p>Sometimes in Jack's saloon down at Stanley, he
has been known to sit and stare out over the dark
ocean, to sit and often mutter:</p>

<p>"Was it right, after all&mdash;was it worth while&mdash;was
it?"</p>

<p>But he is a sober, quiet, industrious man, who
goes about his duties without enthusiasm, without
effort.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WRECK OF THE "RATHBONE"</h2></div>


<p>"Eight bells, sir," came the voice from without,
following the <i>rap</i>, <i>rap</i> upon the door
of my room. I had just five minutes to
dress myself and get out, and I rolled over, listening
to the sounds on deck. As I had only taken off my
sea boots, I was in no hurry to turn to. My sou'wester
hung upon a peg, but my oilskin jacket was
still buttoned up close about my neck, where it had
been during my sleep; and the oilskin trousers
scraped noisily as I slid my legs to the edge of the
bunk.</p>

<p>I had slept three hours and forty minutes, and
must go out and relieve Slade, the second mate,
who had, in turn, relieved me at the end of the mid-watch.
It was now just five minutes of four in the
morning, a cold, snowy nor'easter blowing, and the
brig running wildly into the thick of it.</p>

<p>We had cleared from New York for Rio, and
were trying to run out into the warm Gulf Stream
before the gale overblew us and forced us to heave
to, to ride it down. January at sea on the coast
was hard, indeed.</p>

<p>I swore at the hard luck, for my sleep had seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
just an instant, just a second's unconsciousness, and
I was stiff and soaked with sea water; so cold that
I had to keep on my oilskins to sleep at all. I had
finally steamed my body, incased as it was, into
some sort of warmth, and the first movement sent
the chills running down my spine. I threw off my
blankets and stood shivering, trying to jam my feet
into the wet boots as the bells struck off, and I was
due on deck.</p>

<p>Slade stood with his shoulders hunched to his
ears at the break of the poop, holding to the rail
to steady himself as the brig plunged and tore along
under a reefed fore-topsail and close-reefed spanker,
with the wind abaft the beam. The gray light of
the winter morning had not come yet, and the snow
beat upon my face, as if some invisible hand hurled
it from the utter blackness to windward.</p>

<p>The dull, snoring roar of the wind under the feet
of the topsail told of the increasing velocity of the
squalls; and the quick, live jerk of the ship as she
went rushing along the crest of a roller for an instant,
and then slid along the weather side, dropping
stern foremost into the trough, with a heave to
windward, indicated that we were doing all we
could.</p>

<p>"Southeast b'south!" yelled Slade into my ear.
"You'll have to watch her."</p>

<p>I knew what he meant. She was steering hard,
and might broach to in any careless moment.</p>

<p>"Call the old man if there's any change," he
added, and stumbled down the poop steps to the
main deck, where the watch were huddled under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
lee of the deck house. Then he disappeared aft,
and the night swallowed him up.</p>

<p>I made my way to the wheel. Bill, a strong West
Indian negro, was holding her steady enough, meeting
her as she came to and swung off. He was assisted
by Jones, a sturdy little fellow with a big
shock head. I could just make out their faces in
the light from the binnacle, which burned, for a
wonder, in spite of the gale. It generally blew out
in spite of all we could do to keep the lamps lit.
Beyond was a hopeless blackness.</p>

<p>I went to the weather rail and tried to see to
windward. A fleeting glimpse of a white comber
caught my gaze close aboard; but beyond a few
fathoms I could see nothing at all. Aft under the
stern the torrent of dead water boiled and roared,
showing a sickly flare from the phosphorus. We
were going some, probably twelve or fifteen knots
an hour; and right ahead was nothing&mdash;that is,
nothing we could see; just a black wall of darkness.</p>

<p>Vainly I tried to make out the light of the coming
morning; but the snow squalls shut off everything.
Pete, sharp-eyed fellow of my watch, was
on lookout on the forecastle head. I knew Pete's
eyes were the best ever, but he could see nothing
in that wild gale of snow and sleet and inky darkness.
I went to the break of the poop again, and
hailed the deck below.</p>

<p>"Keep a sharp lookout ahead, there," I said, bawling
the words out to reach through the storm. Then
I stood waiting, for there was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Two bells came&mdash;five o'clock&mdash;and the watch reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
all well and the lights burning brightly. Our
starboard and port&mdash;green and red&mdash;lights were
none too bright at any time, yet they were well
within the law, and had served the ship for five
years or more.</p>

<p>I answered the hail, and stood trying again to
see something over the black hills of water that
were rushing to the southwest under the pressure
of the gale. Something made me very nervous. I
began to shiver, and the snow struck my face and
melted enough to run down my neck, making me
miserable, indeed. I still stood gazing right ahead
into the night, hoping for the dawn which was now
due in another hour, when I heard a yell from the
forecastle head.</p>

<p>"Light dead ahead, sir," came the hail.</p>

<p>I looked and saw nothing, but took Pete's word
for it.</p>

<p>"Keep her off all she'll go," I roared to the wheel.</p>

<p>And just as I felt her swing her stern to the following
sea, I saw close to us the green light of a
steamer, and above it her masthead light. Then
the thing happened.</p>

<p>A wild cry from forward, followed by the loom
of a gigantic object in the gloom ahead. We were
upon the vessel in a moment.</p>

<p>A tremendous crash, grinding, tearing, splintering.
The brig staggered, seemed to stop suddenly,
and then the deep, roaring note of the gale smothered
the rest.</p>

<p>We struck, fairly head on, swung to, glanced
along the ship's side, and were lying dismasted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the trough of the sea, our foremast over the side,
and nothing but the lower main mast standing. The
seas tore over us, and we lay like a log, while the
shadow of the steamer passed slowly astern.</p>

<p>The old man was on deck before I knew just
what had happened. So also was Slade. The
smashing and grinding of the wreckage alongside
told of the spars; but we were too stunned to think
of them.</p>

<p>Was the hull split open with that furious impact?
That was the thought in our minds. Ours was a
wooden vessel&mdash;little, light, and very strong. Did
we ram our plank ends in? If so, we were lost
men, all of us.</p>

<p>It was fully a half minute before we spoke of
it. We knew just what to do, but we were stunned
for a few moments. Then we made for the main
deck, and tried the pumps. The water was coming
in lively.</p>

<p>"All hands on the pumps!" came the skipper's
order; and we manned the brakes with the feeling
that it was just a respite, just a little time to lose.
The men took to them with a will, however; but I
had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach,
and I worked half-heartedly for a few minutes, until
I brought myself around with a jerk. I was mate.
I had the responsibility. And more than that&mdash;it
had happened in my watch on deck. I was the one
who must do the most.</p>

<p>"Come along, bullies&mdash;get a couple of axes!" I
roared, and made my way to the weather fore channels,
where the rigging of the topmast and lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
mast held the wreckage alongside, being drawn taut,
as it were, across the deck, the spars to leeward, and
banging and pounding against the ship with each
surge. "Get into those lanyards!" and they chopped
away in the gray light of the morning, cutting
everything they could, and clearing the weather rigging
of the strain.</p>

<p>The wreckage now hung by the lee rigging, and
drifted farther aft. The wheel was lashed hard
down, and a bit of spanker raised again upon the
mainmast, the halyards still being intact, although
the boom had been broken by the shock. We soon
had canvas on her aft, and she headed the sea, dropping
back from the wreckage to a mooring hawser
bent to the standing rigging of the foremast. We
got a lashing to the foot of the mast, and she
dragged the mass broadside, making a lee of it, and
riding easily to the heavy seas, which now took her
almost dead on her bows.</p>

<p>When I had a chance to look about me again,
the light of the morning had grown to its full
height, and we were able to see around us.</p>

<p>The gray light made things look almost hopeless
for us. The pumps worked full stroke, and the
water gained rapidly on us. There had been three
feet made during the first half hour. We were settling,
and the brig was riding more heavily, taking
the seas over her head with a smothered feeling that
told of what was coming.</p>

<p>I had a chance to breathe again, and I looked out
over the gray ocean, where the white combers rolled
and the heavy clouds swept along close to their tops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
A large, black object showed to the westward of us,
and we recognized her as a steamer. She was very
low in the water, and upon her rigging floated the
signal, "<i>We are sinking.</i>" She was the one we had
run down.</p>

<p>The old man stood gazing at her as I came on
the poop. He was trying to make her out; and
this he did finally, when the wind stretched her flag
in a direction so that we could see it plainly. She
was one of the Havana steamers bound up from
Cuba, and was about five thousand tons. Her number
was that of the <i>William Rathbone</i>.</p>

<p>"No better fix than we are," snarled the skipper.
"What was the matter? Didn't you see him? He's
big enough."</p>

<p>"Too dark," I said. "You know what kind of a
night it was&mdash;look at it now. We might do something
if we were sure of floating ourselves&mdash;no boat
would live in this sea five minutes; but it'll smooth
out, maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe blow a hurricane!" howled the old man,
his voice rising above the gale. "Get the boats ready,
anyhow&mdash;get the steward to put all the grub he can
get in them&mdash;too bad, too bad," he went on.</p>

<p>While Slade helped to get the boats ready for
leaving the brig, I went to the bow and tried to see
just what damage we had done ourselves. It was
dangerous work, as the seas came over in solid
masses, and more than once I came near getting
washed overboard. Splintered plank ends, a crushed
stem showed through the wreck of the bowsprit,
which still hung by the bobstays and shrouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
jammed foul of the catheads, so that only the end
swung, and struck us a blow now and then. It
was a hopeless mess.</p>

<p>A great sea rose ahead, with its crest lifting for
a break, and I ducked behind the windlass, holding
on with both hands. The solid water swept over
the bows, and I was almost drowned; but I held on.
There was nothing I could do forward, and no men
could work there. The steady grind of the pumps
took the place of desperate rushing about the decks.
The men stood in water to their knees as the seas
swept her, but they still kept it up. As fast as one
man gave out another took his place, regardless of
watch; and the waiting ones chafed under the shelter
of the mainmast.</p>

<p>The boats were on booms over the forward house,
where the seas could not wash them away; and
Slade had them all ready to leave, although it was
a study how to get them overboard in that sea with
nothing forward to raise them with. The mainstay
still held, and the mainmast was strong enough;
but there was nothing forward at all above them.
I went aft and waited.</p>

<p>Old Captain Gantline was still standing at the
poop rail watching the steamer. Our drift was
about equal to hers, and we sagged off to leeward
together, keeping about a mile apart. The steamer
was settling.</p>

<p>"Of course, he ought to have gone clear of us!"
howled the old man as I came up. "I don't blame
you, Mr. Garnett; I don't blame you&mdash;but you certainly
swung us off at the last minute when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
knew the law was to hold your course, and let him
get out of our way."</p>

<p>"But he was dead ahead, sir. I saw his lights
right aboard. To luff meant to come to in that sea,
and that would have been just as bad, for he'd
have struck us aft&mdash;probably cut us in two."</p>

<p>I really had done nothing out of the way. The
steamer had not seen us, that was certain. I was
supposed, under the law, to hold on until the last
moment, and I had done so. I had only swung her
off a little; tried to clear when I saw he would not.
I knew the law well enough, and had followed it
up to the moment of striking. Our swing off had
made our bows fetch up against the steamer, and
had probably caused him serious damage. But it
had saved us from being cut down by her sharp
steel stem, which would have gone through our
wooden side as if through butter.</p>

<p>No, I did not feel guilty; although there were
evidently some hundred passengers and crew of that
ship in dire peril and sore put to it. The old man
knew I had done the best thing I could for us, and
there was no possible way of avoiding a collision
in a wild, thick night like the last when the ships
were invisible but a few fathoms distant.</p>

<p>We waited, and the brig settled slowly, while the
wind still held from the northeast, and the sea still
ran strong and high. There was apparently no
chance for launching a small boat. The scud
flew fast and the gray wind-swept ocean looked
ugly enough, the surface covered with white. The
steamer was slowly sinking, like ourselves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
it was only a question whether either would go
through the day or not. I hoped that it would not
come in the night. There's something peculiarly
nerve-racking in wild night work in a sinking ship.
The very absence of light lends terror to the already
awful situation, and the wild rush of the wind
and seas makes chaos of the blackness about.</p>

<p>The day dragged slowly. It was like waiting for
the end of the world. The vessels drifted apart but
another mile or two, and we were still close enough
to exchange signals. We had long ago run ours up,
telling that the same state of affairs existed aboard
the brig. If some passing coasting steamer came
along, all might still be well with the passengers
and crews of both of us. But not a sign of anything
showed above the horizon.</p>

<p>At five o'clock&mdash;two bells&mdash;that evening, the brig
was well down in the water; and she was taking the
seas nastily over her. The main deck was all but
impossible to remain upon, and the men at the
pumps had to lash themselves to keep there. It
would be only a question of a few hours now. The
drawn faces told of the strain. Slade, the second
mate, came to me.</p>

<p>"All over but the shouting," he said. "How'll we
ever get them boats clear in this sea?"</p>

<p>"Better start now before it's too late," I said, and
went to the old man for orders.</p>

<p>"All right, get them over," said the old man, in
answer to my question; and we started on the last
piece of work we were to do in that brig.</p>

<p>Bill, the West Indian negro; Wilson; Peter, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Dutchman; and Jones were to row; and, with myself
at the steering oar in command, made the working
crew. Besides these men we had three others,
making eight men all told for our boat. Slade went
with the old man, dividing the little crew up evenly.</p>

<p>We had a good crew. Long training in that little
ship had made them good men. But for their steadiness
we would never have got those boats clear. It
was desperate work getting them over the side without
smashing them. With a tackle upon the main,
however, we managed to lift them clear and let
them swing aft, lifting and guying them out by
hand. Then we dropped them over the quarter, and
let them tow astern to the end of a long line, and
they rode free, being lighter than the ship and pulling
dead to leeward.</p>

<p>I was the first to leave, as became my place. The
old man, as captain, must be the last. I hauled the
boat up, and we climbed in, jumping the now short
distance as she took the seas and rose close to the
taffrail. The brig was very low, and settling fast.</p>

<p>"Go to the steamer first," said the old man; "then
head westerly until you get picked up or get ashore.
We are not more than one hundred and fifty miles
off&mdash;good-by."</p>

<p>I dropped over, and the line was cast off, letting
the boat drift slowly back, but still heading the sea
so that she rode almost dry, in spite of the combers.</p>

<p>The <i>Rathbone</i> was in view about three miles distant,
and by the weight upon the four oars we held
her so that she drifted off bodily in that direction,
while still heading well up to the wind. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
plenty of light left yet, but there was a night coming,
and I hoped we would get a chance to board
the big vessel before it was black dark. Perhaps
she was not so dangerously hurt as she looked.</p>

<p>I saw the old man's boat come away and take the
general direction of our own; but the seas were too
high to see her often. She was evidently making
good weather of it, and I thanked the lucky stars
that we had whaleboats for our business, and not
the tin things they use for lifeboats in steamers.</p>

<p>By keeping the boat's head quartering to the wind
and sea, she drifted bodily off toward the <i>Rathbone</i>,
and before dark we drew close aboard.</p>

<p>There was much action taking place on her decks
as we came close enough to see. Passengers ran
about, and forms of seamen dashed fore and aft.
It was evident that they were hurrying for some
purpose, and that purpose showed as we noted the
list to starboard the ship had. She was very low
forward, and seemed to be ready to take the final
plunge any moment.</p>

<p>Our boat had been pretty badly smashed getting
her overboard, and she was leaking badly from the
started seams. In that strong, rolling sea she had
all she could do with the crew in her; and I fervently
hoped that I would not be called upon to take
passengers. Four rowing and three for relief was
all right, but a dozen more would swamp her.</p>

<p>We came close under the <i>Rathbone's</i> lee. She lay
broadside to the sea, and her high stern, raised as it
were by her sinking head, shut off the sweep of the
combers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>"Steady your oars," I commanded, as we came
within a few fathoms. A man in uniform rushed
to the ship's rail and hailed us through a megaphone.
He was followed by several passengers.</p>

<p>"Can you come aboard and help us?" he bawled.
"We're sinking&mdash;all the boats gone to starboard&mdash;captain
killed and chief mate knocked on the head
by wreckage."</p>

<p>"Men have refused duty," howled a man standing
near him. "Mutiny aboard, and we're going down&mdash;come
aboard and help us."</p>

<p>While they hailed, I noticed the boats to port
going over the side. One had already gone down,
but she had fouled her falls, and had dropped end
up, smashing against the ship's side and filling.
Struggling men tried to clear her, but the sea was
too heavy. A life raft was pushed over the rail,
and fell heavily close to us, held by a line. It
surged in the lee, and, as the ship drifted down, it
struck her heavily, smashing the platform.</p>

<p>"Don't go, sir," said Jake, in a voice that barely
reached me.</p>

<p>"We'll have troubles enough of our own," said
another.</p>

<p>"Shut up, there are passengers&mdash;don't you see the
women?&mdash;we've got to help them," I said.</p>

<p>I looked for the other boat. It was not in sight.
The forms of two women came to the rail, one a
young girl.</p>

<p>"Throw me a line," I yelled to the man in uniform.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>A small line came sailing across the boat. I seized
it, and went forward.</p>

<p>"Jake and you, Bill, come with me, the rest lie
by&mdash;keep her clear whatever you do," I said, and
waved my hand to those above to haul away. With
the bowline under my arms, I was soon on deck.
Then I helped to haul my two men up.</p>

<p>"I'm the second," said the man in uniform; "but
I can't make 'em do anything. Just stretched one
out when the rest knocked me over and took to the
boats."</p>

<p>Without delay we made our way along the port
rail to amidships, where the boats were being lowered.
Men crowded around them, and fought for
places. The fireroom crew, white-skinned and partly
clothed, their pale faces dirty with coal dust, stood
around the nearest boat, and worked at the lashings,
cursing, swearing, and shoving each other in the
suppressed panic of men who are hurrying from
death.</p>

<p>The canvas covering was ripped off, and four
men sprang into her, the rest shoving her bodily
outboard. The men at the falls howled and swore,
slacked off without regard to consequences, and the
craft dropped a few feet, then swung off, and came
with a crash against the side.</p>

<p>"Fine discipline," I said to the second mate, who
was close to me.</p>

<p>A form touched my elbow. I turned, and saw a
young girl.</p>

<p>"Aren't they going to take us along with them?"
she asked quietly, but with a voice full of pleading.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>I looked at her. She was not over twenty, and
very pretty. Her big eyes were looking right into
mine.</p>

<p>"Sure, lady, you shall go," I said.</p>

<p>Jake and Bill stood right behind me.</p>

<p>"Have you a gun?" I asked the officer.</p>

<p>"No; haven't got a thing&mdash;let's hoof 'em."</p>

<p>"Avast slacking that boat down," I roared, rushing
in.</p>

<p>"Tell it to George," snarled a big fireman, shoving
me aside.</p>

<p>I hooked him under the jaw with all my strength,
and he staggered back. Jake slammed the next man
in the stomach, while the second officer waded in
now, striking right and left in the press.</p>

<p>"Get back&mdash;stand back!" we roared; and, for a
wonder, forced our way along the ship's side, taking
the falls.</p>

<p>"Get a line below the block hook. Hold her off,"
came the order, and some one passed a line at the
after fall, while a man in the boat pushed manfully
against the ship's side to steady her.</p>

<p>"Now, then, slack away together," I yelled; and
Bill, who had the forward fall, slacked off with me,
and the craft went rushing down just as the ship
rolled to leeward. She struck the sea, the block unhooked;
and, as the sinking ship rolled up, she fell
clear, and hung to her painter. We had got one
down all right. The men then rushed.</p>

<p>Four of us fought back with all our might; but
the weight of frantic men was too heavy for us.
We were forced back and down, struggling under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the crush of fighting firemen and seamen, who
trampled, struck, and then tore loose to slide down
the hanging boat falls or jump over into the sea,
to climb in the floating craft below. The men below
in the boat saw they would be swamped by numbers,
and cut the painter. She drifted off, then crashed
up against the ship's side, and finally swept around
the stern, where she met the sea. That was the last
I saw of her.</p>

<p>With my clothes half torn off, oilskins hanging
in rags, my face bleeding, and utterly exhausted, I
got to my feet, and we made for the next boat.
The press about her was not so great, and we managed
to make way against it. It was the last boat,
and the remaining few men left aboard were not
enough to hold us. Among them were some passengers,
whom we got aboard&mdash;four of them&mdash;and
then finally sent the boat down clear. I looked
around for the girl. Two women were in the boat,
and the second officer said there was another
aboard. I was out of breath, and stood panting a
few moments, gazing aft through the bloom of the
evening trying to see what had become of that girl.
She was not in sight. I remembered she was near
the other boat.</p>

<p>"I'll run aft and try to find her," I yelled, and
rushed down the deck.</p>

<p>At the door of the saloon I saw a form huddled
up on a transom just inside.</p>

<p>"Come," I called roughly; "come along, quick&mdash;the
boat's waiting."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," she said; and I saw it was the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
I was looking for. She sat up. "Did you ever see
such brutes?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that now. Get a move on&mdash;the boat
won't wait."</p>

<p>As I spoke, I felt the ship drop suddenly forward.
I turned quickly, and gazed forward. It was almost
dark now; but I could see the white surge burst
over the forecastle head.</p>

<p>"She's going," I yelled, and grabbed the girl.</p>

<p>A great sea crashed against the house, bursting
it in, roaring, smashing, and pouring like a Niagara
into the saloon. The deck forward had gone
under, the stern was rising high in the air, and the
slanting deck told me there was not a second to lose.</p>

<p>The girl sprang up, and we dashed together to
the taffrail, which was now fully twenty feet above
the sea. There was nothing below but that life raft,
the boats had gone to leeward to keep clear. Without
a moment's hesitation, I dropped the girl into
the sea, and sprang after her.</p>

<p>Hampered with my ragged clothes and oilskins,
I could hardly swim a stroke. A rushing comber
struck me, and I felt myself going down, unable to
fight any longer. My breath was gone.</p>

<p>When I came to I was lying upon the life raft,
and the girl was clinging to me with one hand, and
passing one of the lashings of the raft with the
other. It was black dark. Only the rushing seas
about me told of our whereabouts; and the wild
flings of the raft as it swept along with the rush
made me aware of the present. I tried to see, raised
my head, and felt very weak.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>"How'd we get here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I grabbed you and pulled you up," she said
simply. "You were hit on the head by it&mdash;better
tie yourself fast with that piece of cord, I can't hold
you any longer."</p>

<p>I took a few turns of the side lashings of the
raft about our bodies, and, as the seas washed us, I
noticed that the water felt so much warmer than
the air. We were clear of the sea a few inches,
but each comber dashed over and soaked us, washing
so heavily that it was necessary to hold one's
head up in order to breathe freely.</p>

<p>"Did you see the boats?" I asked. "They'll pick
us up presently."</p>

<p>"No; I couldn't see anything. I had all I could
do to pull you on the raft. You're pretty heavy, you
know. Then I had to hold you for what seemed
an hour, but maybe was only a few minutes. Do
you think they'll find us?"</p>

<p>"Sure. They wouldn't leave us. Ship went
down, didn't it&mdash;rather sudden, and they had to let
go. My men will stand by if it takes all night," I
said.</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope you are right about it. I don't
much fancy this raft for a place to spend the night.
Will we be drowned on it, do you think?"</p>

<p>"No fear; we're all right. It can't sink. All we
have to do is to keep a lookout for a boat and sing
out for help. Why, there's five boats altogether,
counting ours. Five boats, and it's just dark, not
after six or seven o'clock at the most."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>"How far from land are we?" she asked, seemingly
cheered but still somewhat doubtful.</p>

<p>"Not far," I lied. I thought of a hundred and
fifty miles of floating to get in&mdash;if the boats didn't
pick us up. I began to experience that sinking feeling
that comes to many when the outlook seems
pretty bad.</p>

<p>The girl was silent for some time after this, and
seemed to be thinking of her troubles, for once she
gave a little gasp of complaint.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," I said; "don't give way to it yet.
We'll be all right soon."</p>

<p>As the hours passed and no boat come near, I began
to feel very nervous. I could see but a few
fathoms distant, and knew the chances were growing
less and less. I hailed the blackness, bawled
out as loud as I could, keeping it up at minute intervals.
The wind seemed to be going down, but
the sea still ran quickly, and was high and strong,
lifting the raft skyward at each roll, and then dropping
it down gently into the hollow trough. We
felt the wind only when on the top of the seas, and
it chilled us; but the warm edge of the Gulf Stream
soaked us, and we could stand it for a long time.
The sea was as warm as milk.</p>

<p>How that long night passed I don't know. It
seemed like eternity. Several times I lost consciousness,
whether from exhaustion or from the
blow I had received upon the head I cannot say. I
held to the girl, and together we stood it out. Our
lashings kept us upon the piece of platform remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
upon the two hollow iron cylinders comprising
the raft.</p>

<p>The girl lost her power of speech some time during
the night, and seemed to faint, her head dropping
upon the slats of the platform. I held it up
to keep the water from her nose and mouth, and
finally propped her head so that little water broke
over it. It was all I could do.</p>

<p>The raft swung around and around, sometimes
with the sea on one side and then with it upon another.
I felt for the oarlock, which is usually placed
at either end to steer by, but it was gone. So also
were the oars that had been placed between the cylinders
and the platform. We simply had a float,
that kept us bodily out of the sea, and that was all.</p>

<p>After hours and hours of this wild pitching and
rushing upon the crests of high, rolling seas, the
motion began to get easier, and I noticed that the
wind was rapidly falling. The crests no longer
broke with the furious rush and tumble as formerly.
Then the gray light of dawn came, and I began to
see about us.</p>

<p>The form of the girl lay alongside me, lashed to
the platform. Her hair trailed into the sea in long
tresses from her head, and her face was white as
chalk. I thought she was dead, and shook her to
see if there was any life to stir up. She lay limp.
I took her hand and felt the wrist. A slight pulse
told of the vital spark still burning. It seemed
brutal to arouse her, to bring her back to the horror
of her position. But I felt that it was best. I
called to her, and she finally opened her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
She shivered, placed one arm under her, and then
raised herself painfully into a sitting posture.</p>

<p>"Cut the cord around my wrist, will you, please?"
she said. "I promise not to fall off."</p>

<p>"Better let it stay," I said. "I'll loose it so you
can move about a little. Seems like they missed us
in the dark."</p>

<p>"Well, do you still think they'll pick us up? See;
it's light now, the sun is coming up. I don't know
as I care very much. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Sure I care. Why not? We'll be all right
soon."</p>

<p>She let her head fall forward, and gave a little
sob; just a bit of a cry.</p>

<p>"Well, then I'm glad I pulled you out of the
water," she said. "Seems like we might just as
well have gone during the night. Do you really
think it's worth struggling for like this? Life is
good&mdash;and I want to live&mdash;but this is too hard&mdash;too
terrible&mdash;and my poor mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll be picked up before breakfast, sure," I
said. "The boats must have drifted just the same
as ourselves. Something'll come along soon."</p>

<p>And yet deep down in me I knew that this was
a bare chance. We were out of the track of ships,
well off shore for the coasters, and not far enough
for the Bermuda ships, like the <i>Rathbone</i>, which
had stopped at the island on her way north.</p>

<p>The sun rose, and daylight broadened into the
morning. The wind fell rapidly, and the sea began
to get that easy run of the Atlantic when undisturbed.
I loosened my lashings and stood up, gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
about us. The motion of the raft was still
severe; but I could stand, balancing myself. I
shivered and shook with the wet and cold; but I
now felt that with the sun shining we would soon
be in better straits. As the raft rose upon the
swells I looked all around the horizon. But there
was nothing; not a thing save the sea in sight.</p>

<p>"You can't see anything?" The girl's voice
sounded strange, querulous, and pitiful. She was
sitting with her head bowed upon her hands, which
rested on her knees. Her wet dress clung to her,
and she looked very frail, very delicate.</p>

<p>"No; I can't see anything yet," I answered; "but
we'll sight something before long. Tell me, were
you from Bermuda?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was visiting my aunt there," she said.
"I just graduated from the convent of the Sacred
Cross last month. I've never been anywhere, or
seen anyone, until this year. My mother is the only
other near relative I have living."</p>

<p>"Well, you've made a good start seeing things,"
said I, trying to smile at her. She turned a little
pink, just flushed a bit; but it gave her white face
a more natural look. She was a very pretty girl.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Eighteen. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I felt like a fool. Why should I bother this child
about her age? She had saved my life by dragging
me upon the raft, and I would save hers, if possible.
It produced a feeling in me I could not quite
understand. I liked to hear her talk, to have her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
look at me. She was very pretty; a good, innocent
young girl.</p>

<p>"I could eat a house, roof, and foundation," I
ventured finally, seating myself. The wash of the
sea now hardly reached us, and we were drying out
fast in the cool breeze and sunshine.</p>

<p>"Yes; I could eat a ship, masts, and spars," I
went on.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I'll be tough enough," she said,
glancing at me with some show of fear in her eyes.
"I once read of men on a raft who ate each other;
but I never thought it would be my turn. No,
never."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd," I said. "I don't intend to eat
you&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>She looked at me very hard. Her eyes were
moist; big, lustrous eyes. "No," she said seriously,
"I don't believe you will," and she put her hand in
mine.</p>

<p>"Aw, don't be frightened, kid," I said. "I may
look like the devil, but I'm not."</p>

<p>And I sat there like an idiot holding that girl's
hand, while the sun rose and shone warmer and
warmer upon us, drying our garments and cheering
us wonderfully. I had never met a girl of this
kind before; and it was something of a problem how
I was to keep her alive and cheerful on that raft. I
swore fiercely at Jake, at Jones, and the rest for
leaving us adrift. My oaths were something strange
to the girl, for she shivered and drew her hand
away.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>"Please don't," she said quietly. "What good
does it do to use such language?"</p>

<p>"Eases me a lot, miss. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Alice Trueman."</p>

<p>I mumbled the name a few times, then relapsed
into silence. After that there was nothing more
said for a long time; but I saw her looking at me
at intervals. Evidently I was an animal she was
not used to, and I wondered at a mother who would
bring up a girl to view a man as such a terrible
sort of creature. I was a rough sailor; but I was
human.</p>

<p>The day advanced and the wind fell to a gentle
breath. Then it became quite still, a dead calm,
while the swell rolled steadily in from the eastward,
but smoothed out into long, easy hills and hollows,
upon which the raft rode easily and the platform
kept clear of the sea at last.</p>

<p>We took turns standing up and looking about the
surrounding waste to see if there were any signs
of a ship. Nothing showed upon the horizon, and
the day wore down to evening. We were both very
hungry and thirsty. I knew that the limit would
soon be reached if there were nothing to eat or
drink. The sun was now warm, and we ceased shivering
as it settled in the west. The darkness of the
night came on with its terrors, and still there was
no sign of help from anywhere.</p>

<p>"I really don't think I can stand it any longer,
captain," said the girl.</p>

<p>"I'm not the captain&mdash;just the mate," I answered;
"but you'll have to stick it out for the night."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>Miss Alice gave a little sob. "I'm <i>so</i> hungry and
thirsty," she wailed. And added plaintively: "I've
never been hungry in my life before."</p>

<p>"Probably not," I said, sitting close to her and
taking her hand in mine again. She made no resistance,
and I passed my arm about her. "You
must remember you've seen very little of the world
yet. I've been hungry often&mdash;expect to be again before
I go."</p>

<p>"You see, I've had everything in the world I
wanted. My father died very rich&mdash;and I can't
stand the things people can who are used to them,"
she lamented.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," I said. "While there's life there's
hope, you know."</p>

<p>She gave a little sigh, and let her head fall back
upon my shoulder. And so we sat there in the
growing darkness, together upon a raft in the middle
of the Atlantic. As I look back upon it, there
seems to be a bit of sentiment lacking. I felt nothing
but pity for the girl at the time. I wasn't the
least unhappy. I wasn't the least disturbed, except
that hunger was gnawing at me and the fear the
girl would die there. Personally I was not displeased
with the position. Such is youth.</p>

<p>"Alice," I said finally, "I find a lot of comfort in
you being here with me, but I honestly believe I
could stand it better if you were safe ashore.
You've been a mighty brave little companion
though."</p>

<p>She gave my hand a bit of a squeeze, and sighed
like a tired child. Then she closed her eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>I was aroused by a hail.</p>

<p>"Hey, there, aboard the raft!" came a yell from
the darkness.</p>

<p>"Boat, ahoy!" I howled, in desperation, hardly
believing my ears.</p>

<p>"Stand by and catch the line," came the yell
again, and I jumped up and stared into the gloom.</p>

<p>A dark spot showed close aboard. The sound of
oars came over the water. A man's voice hailed
again, and I recognized Jones, my bow oarsman.</p>

<p>"Mr. Garnett&mdash;&mdash;Is it you?" he cried; and a
line came hurtling across the platform, striking me
in the face. I seized it, snatched a turn upon one
of the slats of the platform. The boat came alongside,
while they held her off with the oars and boat
hook.</p>

<p>"A girl&mdash;one of the passengers, hey?" asked
Jones. "Climb aboard, sir, and we'll take her in all
safe enough."</p>

<p>Wilson and Jones sprang upon the platform, and
helped me lift the girl to her feet. She opened her
eyes at the motion, and gave a cry of joy.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad!" she said, and fainted dead away,
while we placed her in the stern of the whaleboat.</p>

<p>"Water, in the name of Heaven!" I panted. "You
cowards! Why did you leave us?"</p>

<p>"Hunted for you, sir, all night," said Jones, getting
at the water breaker and measuring out a full
quart. I held it to the lips of the girl, and she revived
enough to drink part of it. I drank the rest,
and drew another measure, drinking it off in a gulp.</p>

<p>"Grub," I said, without further ado; and, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
they shoved clear of the raft, I took a share of the
ship's biscuit, eating ravenously.</p>

<p>"Sit up and chew a bit of bread," I said to Miss
Alice.</p>

<p>She raised herself with an effort, and soon recovered
sufficiently to eat something. Then she
nestled close to me, let her head fall again upon my
shoulder, and went to sleep like a tired child.</p>

<p>We were heading almost due west for the coast
now, and could not be very far away from coastwise
traffic. I felt that the end would soon come,
and that we would be picked up.</p>

<p>Before midnight a light showed ahead. It was a
steamer's headlight, and I soon made out her green
light, showing she was heading north, inside of us.
We would pass very close.</p>

<p>"Give way strong; give way together. Let's get
out of this," I said; and the men set to the oars.</p>

<p>The light grew brighter, the green still showing.
Soon the black form of the ship's hull showed
through the gloom, her masthead light now looming
high in the air, and her side light close aboard. We
were drawing in, and I stood up and bawled out
for help. The black bulk of her hull towered over
us, and for an instant it seemed that she would
run us down.</p>

<p>"Hold&mdash;back water&mdash;hold hard!" I yelled, and
the men obeyed.</p>

<p>The ship tore past us, the foam of her bow wave
splashing into the boat. I roared out curses upon
the men above in her. Then she went on into the
night. I howled, swore at her, called her skipper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
every name I could devise. The men seconded me,
and together we called down enough curses upon
that ship to have sunk her. Suddenly she seemed to
slow up, to stop, and then lay dead in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Row, you bullies, row for your lives!" I yelled;
and the men gave their last spurt, putting their remaining
strength into the pull. We drew closer,
and a voice hailed us from the ship.</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy!" I called again. "Throw us a line
and stand by to pick us up."</p>

<p>We came alongside. A line was dropped down,
and Jones seized it, snatched a turn, and we were
fast. The ship was wallowing slowly ahead; but
we hung alongside safe enough.</p>

<p>"Pass down a bowline," I sang out; "and be
quick about it."</p>

<p>The line came down into the boat, and I slipped
it over the head of Miss Alice Trueman, jamming it
under her arms.</p>

<p>"H'ist away on deck," I directed; and the girl
went aloft. The rest of us came one after the other.</p>

<p>"I can't take your boat, sir," said the captain;
"haven't any room."</p>

<p>"Forget the boat. Give me something to eat and
drink, and a place to lie down for a few weeks," I
said, and I was led below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days later we were at the dock in New York.
I had not seen Alice since she had been turned over
to the care of the stewardess; but I waited for her
to come on deck. She came, pale but self-possessed.
She was still weak, but was now nearly recovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
The ship was being warped to the pier, and it would
be a few minutes before we could leave her. I came
up and held out my hand.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "Alice, how about it? You were
a good companion in trouble, a brave shipmate in
the face of terrible danger. Somehow it has drawn
me to you. I want to see you again."</p>

<p>"Always, Mr. Garnett; always will I be glad to
see you&mdash;but do you think it wise under the circumstances?
Don't you think we had better say
good-by now? It will only be more difficult later
on. You know what I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up at me with moist eyes&mdash;eyes that
told so much. I was taken all aback; but I understood.
I was only a sailorman, a mate of a sailing
ship. She was an heiress&mdash;a lady, as they say, educated
and refined. She couldn't make me what she
knew I would have to be to retain her respect and
love, the love she would want to give. It was for
my own good she was saying good-by. Yes, I believe
she meant it only for that.</p>

<p>"Sure, girl, I was only fooling," I said, with my
throat choking so that the blamed ship reeled and
swung about me.</p>

<p>"Believe me, it's best so," she whispered, looking
at me strangely with eyes now full of tears. She
held out her hand, raised her head, put up her lips.</p>

<p>"Kiss me good-by. You were awful good to me.
Good-by."</p>

<p>I felt that kiss burn my lips for many a day&mdash;yes,
for a long time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE AFTER BULKHEAD</h2></div>


<p>After coming home from the East I had,
like many other ship's officers, taken up
steam. There was more in it than the old
wind-jammers, and the runs were short in comparison.
It was not long before I went in the Prince
Line, as they needed navigators badly.</p>

<p>I was chief mate of the liner, and it was my unpleasant
duty to do about everything. Old Man
Hall, captain and R. N. R. man, did little beside
working the ship's position after we got to sea.
Ashore, he left everything to Mr. Small and myself,
as far as the ship was concerned, and if there were
a piece of frayed line, a bit of paint chafed, we
heard all about it within two hours after he came
aboard.</p>

<p>Small was second under me, while the third and
fourth officers were hardly more than apprentices,
both being for the first time in the ship and not more
than twenty-one or two years of age.</p>

<p>Captain Hall was nearly seventy, and somewhat
decrepit, but he was an accurate navigator, and had
kept his record clean, making one hundred runs
across the Western Ocean without accident.
Masters of merchantmen are good or bad, accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>ing
to their records, according to their reputations.
Some said Hall had excellent luck. But, anyway, he
was a good man, a fair-minded skipper, and he always
brought in his ship on schedule, which was
saying a good deal, for the Prince Line steamers
were not noted for keeping close to time&mdash;any old
time was good enough for most of them until the
<i>Prince Gregory</i>, of twenty thousand tons, came
along and made the lubbers look up a bit.</p>

<p>She was the largest ship of the fleet&mdash;which comprised
ten good steamers&mdash;and she was fitted with
all the modern conveniences, from telephones to
wireless, had a swimming pool, barber shop, gymnasium,
caf&eacute;, and elevators to the hurricane deck.</p>

<p>With only four watch officers, and six cadets,
who were about as useful as a false keel on a trunk,
I had enough to do before clearing.</p>

<p>The chief engineer was an American, for a wonder,
and his six assistants, including donkey man,
were Liverpool cockneys. They drove a swarm of
fire rats and coal passers that would have made a
seaman crazy in two days, but Smith took things
easy below, and, although he had to push her to
keep the new record, he let his assistants do the
heavy work. That's the reason he grew so fat&mdash;grew
fat and even-tempered, while poor Small and
myself sweated out our lives after the usual routine.</p>

<p>We had forty men in the crew, and needed more,
for we often had a thousand emigrants in the steerage.
Sometimes we carried bunches of those big
chaps from the European forests, Lithuanians,
strong, sturdy brutes, totally without sense.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>It was in December that we took over five hundred
of them on board, and while I was polite as
possible, I put Small wise to keep a lookout on the
critters. They were miners, for the most part. Contract
men, going to the mines in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>By some means a quantity of their baggage got
below with that of the cabin passengers. We had
a lot of cabin folks that voyage. There was a
bunch of actors, men and women you hear at the
opera, drummers galore, buyers who were coming
home from the fall trading, several millionaires;
and, among the society or upper-strata people, the
ones without occupation to give them distinction,
were the Lady Amadoun and her following.</p>

<p>Lady Amadoun was American born, but French
by adoption, or, rather, marriage, preferring in her
youth the suave manners of older generations to the
rougher ones of her own countrymen. Raoul,
Vicomte Amadoun, her husband, had not turned out
the soft and gentle creature he appeared before marriage.
In fact, he had followed the usual time-worn
game of demanding money at unusual crises, which,
as you know, has a tendency to make intelligent
women think twice before coming across with it.
The Vicomtesse Amadoun, or countess, as they
called her, was young; in fact, looked hardly twenty-five&mdash;but,
of course, a countess has maids to fix her
up a bit!</p>

<p>You see, being first officer, and sitting at the head
of my own table in the saloon, the countess came
under my observation more than I intended. Old
Hall had his own cronies, who sat with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Driggs, the steward, gave the most prominent passenger
my right-hand seat&mdash;sort of compliment.
Driggs was a good steward, and owed his place to
my exertions in his behalf.</p>

<p>It was about this confounded baggage that I had
a chance to further acquaint myself with nobility,
for the trunks of the countess&mdash;and she had about
fifty, including those of her friends who came with
her&mdash;got mixed with the stuff that the baggage-master
had sent by mistake to the first-class baggage
room&mdash;the unlovely dunnage of the human
moles who were roosting low in the steerage, and
paying two pounds sterling a head for the privilege.</p>

<p>"I would take it as a great favor if you would
allow me to get into my baggage by to-morrow at
the latest," said the countess, beaming upon me from
the adjacent seat at my table at dinner that day.
"You see, we've been all over Europe, and while
traveling through Russia I picked up some very
pretty furs, which will be nice to use on deck during
this cool sea weather."</p>

<p>"Madam," said I, "I shall be at your service right
after eight bells to-morrow, when I leave the
bridge." So I warned the baggage man, below, to
have the place cleaned out a mite, so that her ladyship
could go below without getting her frock
spoiled from contact with the steerage passengers or
their belongings.</p>

<p>To be sure that he would do my bidding&mdash;he belonged
to the purser's force&mdash;I went below that
morning, and looked the baggage over myself. I
passed in through the steerage, and noted the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
stowed there. Two big brutes of Lithuanians sat
upon their dunnage, and jabbered in their language.</p>

<p>"Hike!" I said abruptly to the pair. "Git away
from the baggage, and let the trunk slingers
dig up."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mister Mate, Mister Chief, we have our
trunks here, also, and want to get to them," answered
one fellow in fairly good lingo.</p>

<p>"Beat it!" I ordered. "Make a get-away as
quick as you can. Only first-class passengers can
take their baggage out, or get a look-in. Why, you
lubber, if every one of you steerage rats wanted to
get into your trunks, it would take about fifteen hundred
stewards and baggage men to take care of
you."</p>

<p>"But it is of great importance that we see our
things&mdash;there are some things in my trunk I must
get at, some important things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Try and fergit them until next Wednesday, when
they can be dumped on Ellis Island; nuff sed&mdash;no
more lingo&mdash;beat it!"</p>

<p>The pair went away in very ugly humor, and I
started the work of clearing that baggage room of
their dunnage, and trying to select the trunks of the
countess from the raffle. I managed to get about
twenty of them, and let it go at that.</p>

<p>The next day I took the countess below, and personally
showed her over the trunks. She was accompanied
by the count and her maid.</p>

<p>"Now, Marie, which trunk was it in, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>?
You must remember it very well," she said, looking
at the mass of baggage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>"<i>Mais oui</i>, it must be that grand affaire&mdash;that
beeg one&mdash;see!" And the maid pointed to an immense
Saratoga trunk, big enough to hold the
clothes of a full man-o'-war's crew.</p>

<p>The baggage master and I pulled the trunk out of
the ruck, and the count produced a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>I sauntered over to the other side of the room,
where the gratings separated the steerage from the
rest. The two fellows I saw there yesterday were
watching through the slats, and did not notice me.</p>

<p>"<i>Deux cent</i>," said one, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Whew, <i>mon Dieu</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I knew that there was something about two hundred,
but just what I couldn't quite log. My lingo
goes mostly to Spanish and Chink, having sailed to
those countries.</p>

<p>The countess asked me to move the big trunk to
the side of the ship. I did so without seeing the
reason for the extra work, but the lady was gracious,
and there was really no reason for not doing
it. Two other trunks were opened, and the furs
brought out. Then the lady went on deck again,
after thanking me most profusely. Raoul was more
reticent. He was not the tongue-lashing Frenchman
he looked. He seemed preoccupied; but all
very rich and powerful men seem that way to me,
and after all I was but the chief officer. Perhaps
the skipper would have drawn him out more.</p>

<p>Nothing happened until we were within sight of
the Nantucket Shoals lightship. That night the
countess and her husband were on deck, and, the
air being cool, they were well wrapped in furs. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
watched them from the bridge. They kept well forward,
near the starboard forward lifeboat. That
was my boat under the drill orders, and I remembered
it afterward.</p>

<p>It was about two bells&mdash;nine o'clock in the evening&mdash;when
there was a most terrific roar from below.
The ship shook as though torn asunder. As
I gazed aft, the deck seemed to rise and blow outboard.
Something struck me heavily, and I was
down and out for a few minutes. When I arose
with ringing ears, I looked aft again, hardly realizing
that I was awake and not dreaming. The siren
was roaring full blast, and a throng of men and
women were rushing forward toward the bridge.
Old Hall came out of his room half dressed, and
ran to me.</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;what's happened?" he yelled in my
ear.</p>

<p>"Don't know," I howled, and even then I didn't
believe I was awake.</p>

<p>The chief engineer ran up.</p>

<p>"Starboard engine room full, sir&mdash;something
blowed up below&mdash;whole side gone above water
line&mdash;won't float ten minutes," he howled.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, shut off that siren, then!" yelled
old man Hall. Then, turning to me, he ordered:
"Stand by the boats, and get the passengers out."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the roar of the steam stopped.
Hall stood calmly upon the bridge, and gave the
orders for the small boats, and away they went one
after the other. The wireless was sending its call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
for help, but there was no time for us to listen to
replies; we had plenty to do.</p>

<p>The <i>Prince Gregory</i> settled slowly by the stern,
and raised her bows high in the air. There she
stopped, and, for a wonder, did not fall from under
us.</p>

<p>"Get into the boat, quick!" I said to the countess,
and she sprang with amazing ease into the stern,
followed by her husband and the maid.</p>

<p>"Nix on the men!" I yelled, and grabbed the
count. "Come out&mdash;women first," and I dragged
him from the boat with no show of deference. He
struck me savagely in the face, and I stretched him
out with the boat's tiller. Seamen tossed him aside,
and the swarm of women crowded up and into the
craft while I held the men back as best I could.</p>

<p>I knew it was to be a close haul. Seven hundred
men and women, and only twenty boats! The life
rafts would be doing duty pretty soon, and no mistake.</p>

<p>I saw very little of the fracas around me, as one
never does see much if he is tending to his own
business, and mine at that time was getting forty-five
women into a small boat, many of them in before
she was lowered away.</p>

<p>Luckily there was no sea running at all. It was
calm and foggy, the water like black oil.</p>

<p>I slid down the falls, and when we loaded up I
took command at the tiller, and went out a little distance
to clear the wreck in case of trouble. We lay
at rest a hundred fathoms distant, and watched the
scuffle aboard. Men yelled like mad, screamed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
fought. I caught the flash of a gun, and heard the
report. I knew Hall would not stand for lawless
rushing the boats, and was doing some fierce work.
Pretty soon the outcry died away more and more,
and still the black hull showed plainly, her bow still
pointing skyward, and her stern submerged.</p>

<p>"God's blessing, there's no wind or sea!" I said
to Driscoll, my stroke oarsman.</p>

<p>"You're right there, cap," said he. "What wus
ut anyway?"</p>

<p>"Blessed if I knew&mdash;she's just blowed up, whole
stern gone out of her. She can't float two hours,
and there'll be no one out here before daybreak if
they do get the signal."</p>

<p>"You brute!" exclaimed the countess, who was
sitting close to me. "Why didn't you let my husband
come in this boat?"</p>

<p>"If he was a man, he wouldn't have wanted to,"
I snapped, hot at the insult.</p>

<p>"I notice <i>you</i> are here, all right, you ruffian!" she
retorted, sneering. "What do you call yourself?"</p>

<p>I thought best not to answer her. Words with
women are generally wasted, and the woman always
gets the last one, anyhow. The countess had always
been so courteous and gentle that I supposed
the excitement had turned her head; and then, after
all, I had treated her husband a bit rough. He was
a gentleman, and I was only a mate. That made
a difference in her point of view, although I can't
say it did so much in my own.</p>

<p>I talked to Driscoll, and watched the <i>Prince Gregory</i>
as she lay there in the oily sea. Boats came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and went toward the light vessel, and, thinking it
would be a good thing to get rid of my cargo, I
trailed off after the bunch, and was soon alongside
the lightship.</p>

<p>As fast as we could, we sent the women aboard,
finding that the little ship would hold hundreds of
passengers, in spite of her diminutive size. Inside
of half an hour, she had fully five hundred people
in her, and was jammed to the rails, below and on
deck. Still, it was better than an open boat, and I
kept bringing them by scores, until there were no
more, save a few boatloads, and these we kept afloat
in the lifeboats.</p>

<p>During this time I thought little, or not at all,
about the count. The ship still hung by her after
bulkhead, and Lord knows the man who set it in her
deserves praise enough. How it stood that strain
is a wonder to this day. If there had been any sea
running she would have gone down like a stone, for
no unbraced cross-section of a ship can stand the
surge of ten thousand tons in a seaway. It must
have burst like blotting paper when wetted down.
With ten men&mdash;all second-class passengers&mdash;in my
boat besides the crew, I went back to the ship for
the last time, and watched old man Hall as he stood
upon the bridge. I could just make him out through
the hazy gloom of the night, but I could hear his
voice distinctly, as he gave orders to the few men
who stayed with him.</p>

<p>"Do you want any more help, sir?" I asked, coming
alongside.</p>

<p>"What's that&mdash;you, Jack?" he answered. "No, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
reckon not. She'll hang on for hours, if the weather
remains calm like this. All the passengers
safe?"</p>

<p>"All aboard the lightship, or hanging to her by
painters&mdash;there's a line of boats half a mile long
trailing on behind her, and they're safe enough, as
they can't get lost as long as they hold to her. Tide
runs hard here on the edge of the Stream, but her
wireless is going right along, and she says two cutters
left Boston half an hour ago, under full steam&mdash;ought
to be here before late in the morning, anyway.
Never lost a man, hey?"</p>

<p>"No," says he, "not that I know of; and that's
some remarkable, too."</p>

<p>I thought it was, also, but said nothing more for
a few moments, watching the half-sunken hull
slowly rolling from side to side in the smooth swell.</p>

<p>While I watched I saw the form of a man coming
from aft, along the rail of the main deck, which
was just awash. As every one had left the after
part of the ship and the engine room abandoned, I
thought this strange, and watched the figure until it
came almost amidships. Then it disappeared in the
cabin.</p>

<p>"More men aft, sir?" I asked Hall, who still
stood leaning upon the bridge rail, waiting for help.</p>

<p>"No, no one left aboard&mdash;just Jenkins and his
crew of four men&mdash;myself, that's all." Jenkins was
carpenter.</p>

<p>"Saw a man coming from aft, sir&mdash;must be some
passenger overlooked. Shall I jump up, and see to
him?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>"All right," came the response, and almost before
he spoke the men who waited on their oars shoved
the boat astern until she was almost level with the
sunken deck. I sprang out of her, and sung to
them to lie by and keep clear of the captain's boat,
which lay alongside, just forward of us, waiting
until the old man found it necessary to leave.</p>

<p>I made my way in through the passageway to the
saloon, and found the deck still clear of water, although
the sucking roar and surge of the sea beneath
told of the immense volume in the lower
decks. The lights had long gone out, with the
drowning of the dynamos, and I felt for a cabin
door, intending to grab one of the emergency candles
which are always in place on the bulkheads.</p>

<p>I found one, and struck a light; then made my
way along the passage in front of the lower staterooms,
calling at intervals for any one who might
be near and unable to realize the peril of a foundering
ship. I admit it was some ticklish. I had my
hair raised more than once when the ship took a
more than usually heavy roll, and the rushing thunders
below started with renewed force. What if
she should drop? It was a bad thought, and not
tending to still my pulse. I couldn't help thinking
of the thousand fathoms or so of blue sea beneath
my feet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I thought I heard a footstep crossing the passage
in front of me. It is strange how, above the general
thunder of rushing water, a slight sound makes
itself evident. It was like standing upon the shore
during the running of a heavy surf. One can almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
talk in a whisper while the thunder reverberates
along the coast.</p>

<p>A shadow crossed in front of me, and I hailed
again. It was a man, and he was coming from below,
from the sunken lower decks. He came up the
staircase of the lower saloon, and darted along the
passageway to port.</p>

<p>"Hey, there! Stop!" I yelled.</p>

<p>The man turned, and in an instant I recognized
him. It was the Vicomte Raoul.</p>

<p>He eyed me with a savage look, and waited for
me to come up.</p>

<p>"What ees it you want?" he growled.</p>

<p>"Just you!" I told him. "Don't you know you
are in danger of getting killed down here?"</p>

<p>"And how does that matter interest you?" he retorted,
with those shrugging shoulders and arched
eyebrows he could handle so well.</p>

<p>"It don't, except that, as I'm an officer, it's my
duty to see you leave the ship under orders of the
captain."</p>

<p>"I noticed you were not so queek to have me
leave dees sheep when I first started," he sneered,
"and eef I go back for my jewels, my valuables, eet
ees no affaire of yours&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"It is only to the extent that I must see you off
the vessel," I said.</p>

<p>We were standing near the after companionway,
and I noticed the splintered planking, where the
force of the explosion had blown it upward. It was
directly over the baggage room, where the trunks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
were stowed below. This was now under six to
ten feet of clear water.</p>

<p>"If you want to get into your trunks, you will
have to be a good diver," I said. "There's no
chance in the world of getting below here&mdash;she's
flooded full to the after bulkheads number four in
the wake of the starboard engines. You couldn't
do a thing below if you got there."</p>

<p>In a more courteous tone, the count explained:</p>

<p>"Eet is a matter of small valuables in my room,
not my trunk. Go along like a good fellow, and I
will follow instantly. I just go below to my room&mdash;I
come with you instantly&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll wait here if it don't take too long," I
said. "It's against orders, and if anything happens
to you I'll get it, all right. Hurry up, and beat it
back&mdash;the boat's waiting, and the ship'll drop any
minute. It's only that number four bulkhead holding
her."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, dat number four! Eet ees just at my
stateroom door, zat number four you call heem.
Wait, my good fellow, I come immediate," and he
went down the companionway, which was knee-deep
at the bottom in sea water.</p>

<p>He splashed through the shallow wash, and disappeared
along the gloomy passage, where the candlelight
failed. I stood above and waited, holding my
breath at times, and cursing the luck that made me
weak enough to allow him to do such a foolish
thing as go below for valuables. However, I had
treated him pretty rough at the first getaway, and
felt he had a right to some consideration.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>Suddenly I remembered that his stateroom was
not below on that main deck! It seemed to me he
had rooms forward and above; but the excitement
had caused me to forget this detail, and I was so
taken up, even at the time, that I only remembered
it in a half-dazed way. What did he want below,
then?</p>

<p>I waited, and the minutes flew by, seeming long
enough. The candle ran its hot grease down upon
my hand, and burned it. I was getting sore and
impatient at the wait. If anything happened, I
could never be given a reprimand, for I would never
show up to receive it. The ship would go down and
take me with her, all right enough. I hadn't a
chance in the world&mdash;and I was waiting there for a
count, a man who had sprung into the mate's boat
to get clear, when there were hundreds of women
waiting and screaming to go!</p>

<p>There was a sharp explosion from below. The
ship shook a little, and rolled to port.</p>

<p>"Just Heaven! Did that bulkhead go?"</p>

<p>A form tore down the passageway, splashed
through the water at the foot of the companion,
and was upon me in an instant. Raoul struck me
fairly between the eyes, and I went down to sleep&mdash;that
was all I remember of the inside of the <i>Prince
Gregory</i>, as she lay foundering off the Shoals.</p>

<p>When I came to, I was in the boat, with Driscoll
bending over me and pouring sea water upon my
head. The dark stain showed me that I was bleeding
fast, and the sailor tore off the sleeve of his
jumper, and tied it about my forehead. I tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
sit up, but everything swam and rolled about me
horribly. Finally I managed to get my head up.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Bulkhead gave way, sir," he told me. "You
was hit on the head by wreckage. I run in after
you, an' jest managed to git you clear. She's gone,
sir!"</p>

<p>"What! The ship?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Sure, sir."</p>

<p>"And the old man&mdash;Jenkins, and the rest of
them?"</p>

<p>"All got clear just in time&mdash;seems like Jenkins
and his gang were at the bulkhead from forrards,
trying to shore it up, when <i>bing!</i> she went, and
them as was left beat it&mdash;all got clear, sir."</p>

<p>"See anything of a passenger&mdash;that chap we had
a run-in with at the first getaway?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; one man got away in the skipper's
boat&mdash;that's them headin' for the lightship over
there," and he pointed to a blur that showed through
the hazy night. I began to gather my senses again,
but I couldn't make head or tail of it. What did
that fellow nail me for? I had hit him, to be sure;
but that was for a purpose. He surely intended to
fix me, all right. About a minute more, and I would
have gone with the ship.</p>

<p>"Cowardly rat!" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Driscoll.</p>

<p>"That white-livered dog who knocked me out," I
said, gritting my teeth at the thought.</p>

<p>"Better lie quiet, sir; better keep still&mdash;you're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
bug a bit, but will be all right to-morrow. Does it
hurt you much, sir?"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" I commanded ungratefully, and Driscoll
gazed at me sorrowfully, pulling away again
at his oar, for we were now almost to the lightship.</p>

<p>All that night we lay trailing astern. There was
a long line of lifeboats reaching nearly half a mile
back, all hanging to the taffrail of the ship.</p>

<p>About daylight she got in touch with a passing
passenger ship, bound in, and while we were busy
shifting the hundreds of passengers the cutters
showed up, and helped to expedite matters by towing
the small boats. Before breakfast time we had
all the outfit aboard and away for New York. Hall
and myself went aboard the cutter <i>Eagle</i>. We
waited for several hours, to see if there were anything
more to find drifting about, and then away
we went for home, thanking the captain of the Nantucket
Shoals lightship for what he had done.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it at all&mdash;don't seem to be
just right," repeated Hall over and over to the captain
of the cutter. "She just blew up&mdash;that's all
there is to it. We had a drove of miners aboard,
and you know how hard it is to keep those fellows
from carrying explosives in their dunnage. You
simply can't stop to search them. There was probably
a couple of hundred pounds of blasting powder,
at the least&mdash;went off like a mine blowing up a
battleship. That bulkhead in the wake of the starboard
engine room saved us&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>I was out of a ship. When we got in, the manager
laid me off for a month, and then gave me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
second greaser's berth on the old <i>Prince Leander</i>,
a bum ship&mdash;and that's a fact. When I reached the
other side again, I saw by the papers that a certain
Frenchman had tried to collect nearly a million
francs on his insurance for cargo and personal belongings
in the <i>Prince Gregory</i>. It seems that he
had shipped tons of expensive machinery and had
insured it fully. The stuff was cased tightly, but
one case marked for him had broken while being
handled on the dock, and nothing but bricks fell
out.</p>

<p>The insurance companies held up the claim. I
hurried to the consul's office, and told of the episode
of the trunk, and how I was hit over the nut by a
certain French gentleman during the fracas. The
description answered to the man of machinery, and
when I told of that last little crack I had heard below,
the consul waited not on the order of his going,
but ordered a cab and fairly threw me into it.
We tore to the office of the underwriters, and I told
my tale. Then I began to see the light, at last.</p>

<p>It was the old game tried under a new guise&mdash;and
it had nearly cost the lives of a half thousand human
beings. The horror of it appalled me, and I
found myself wondering if I were to be trusted
about without a nurse again. However, I was not
censured severely. The crook was well known to the
police, and since then the police of many countries
have been trying to locate a gentleman who answers
to the description of the Vicomte Raoul de Amadoun.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CAPTAIN JUNARD</h2></div>


<p>Captain Junard awoke suddenly from a
sound sleep. He listened intently for a few
moments. The steady vibrations of the
ship's engines told of the unchecked motion, the unhindered
rush of the ship through the sea. Yet
something had awakened him, something had given
him a start from a dreamless sleep, the sleep of a
tired man. He knew that something was wrong,
felt it, and wondered at it, while his heart began
to sound the alarm by its increasing pulsations. He
wondered if he were sick, had eaten something that
might produce nightmare; but he felt very well, and
knew he never started at trifles. His hand reached
for the revolver at the head of his bunk. He always
kept it there for emergencies. It was a heavy forty-five,
with a long, blue barrel&mdash;a strong weapon that
had stood him handily in several affairs aboard the
steamer. The light in his room was dim, but there
was enough of it to show him that his room was
empty. His hand reached the spot where the weapon
usually hung, but failed to reach it. He groped
softly for several moments. There was nothing
upon the bulkhead; the gun was gone.</p>

<p>This fact made a peculiar impression upon him.
He felt now that his instinct was correct, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
was indeed in danger. His mind cleared quickly
from the stupor of sound sleep, and he remembered.
He was carrying papers of peculiar importance in
his strong box, or safe&mdash;papers relating to a deal
in shipping connected with a revolution in a Central
American state. A rival line had tried to stop the
affair, which grew into political importance when
secret agents of the United States tried to find out
how deeply it might affect the Panama Canal. The
concession had not been granted. The Canal Zone
was not yet in existence, and the United States was
sure to get it if this deal went through. The president
had watched the affair with hungry eyes. Now
the papers were in his&mdash;Junard's&mdash;possession,
aboard his ship, bound for the state department in
Washington.</p>

<p>Junard started up when he found his hand missing
the butt of that revolver. It had been a pleasant
fancy to him when he remembered its solid grip
and deadly accuracy, a dependable friend in the
hours of darkness and distress. Now it was gone,
and could not have gone without some one having
taken it. If they took it, they took it to keep him
from using it. The idea of its loss awakened him
more than anything else, and sent his heart beating
fast as with sudden quickness and energy he sprang
from his bed. There was nothing in his room,
nothing at all. The lamp burned low. The electrics
had been switched off, as they gave too much light
for him to sleep in. Junard stood wondering, studying,
and gazing at his safe, which lay bolted to the
deck in a corner of his room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>The captain's room was just abaft the pilot house,
as is usual in ships of that class. A stairway, or
companion, of five steps led to the pilot house, but
these were cut flush with his room and into the floor
of the house above, so that he could shut the door.
The door was shut now as he looked, but the sound
of the steering gear told him that the man at the
wheel, within a dozen feet of him, was steering and
attending apparently to his business. The room ran
clear across the superstructure, opening with a door
upon either side. To starboard was his bathroom,
to port was a closet, which adjoined the room of the
chief officer, being separated from it by the bulkhead.
Both these rooms led aft and opened into
his room by doors in the bulkhead. This made his
room a complete section of the superstructure about
twelve feet deep and running clear through. There
was nothing in it that could hide any one. A table,
a couch with leather cushions, several chairs, and a
large desk completed the furniture. His bed was a
large double bunk let in to port and hung with curtains.
It somewhat resembled an old four-poster
bed.</p>

<p>Junard walked quickly to the safe. It was locked.
He smiled at himself. The absurdity of the thing
almost made him laugh. And yet he was as nervous
as a ship's cat when watching a strange dog. He
opened the door leading to the pilot house. The
man in there was standing in regulation pose, with
his hands upon the spokes of the steam steering
gear. The sudden rattle and clank told Junard the
fellow was awake and alert. The dim light from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the binnacle made his outline plainly discernible, and
Junard recognized him as Swan, a quartermaster of
long service and excellent ability.</p>

<p>"How's she heading, Swan?" whispered the captain.</p>

<p>"No'the, two east, sir," said the man, with a
slight start. The words had come to him from the
gloom behind him, and he had not heard the door
open.</p>

<p>"That's right; they haven't reported the Cape
yet?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but that's Cape Maysi, sir, I think," said
Swan, pointing to a light that had just begun to
show right over the port bow. Eight bells struck
off upon the clock in the house as he spoke, and the
cry came from forward. The chief mate, who was
on watch, came to the pilot-house window, reached
in, and took out the night glasses. He adjusted
them and gazed at Cape Maysi. Captain Junard
watched him narrowly, and noted that he took the
bearings and made the remark in his order book.
Mr. Jameson was a good officer and a first-class
navigator, and Junard did not wish to appear on
deck until he was called. It looked as if he did not
trust the officer sufficiently. He would wait until
the light was reported officially.</p>

<p>When Junard turned to re&euml;nter his room, he
heard a slight noise. There was a rustle, a whirl,
and the door of the room to port clicked to. It had
been shut when he jumped from his bunk. He
gazed in the direction of the safe, and saw that it
was now standing wide open, the door swinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
slowly with the motion of the ship. He sprang to
the switch and turned on the light, full power.</p>

<p>In front of him was the safe, with the door open.
In front of the safe lay a huge knife, and alongside
of the knife lay his revolver, fully loaded, and
cocked. Whoever had it was ready to use it upon a
moment's notice. The intruder had fled at the
sound of Junard's steps upon the pilot-house companion.</p>

<p>Junard was a very heavy-set man. He stood but
five feet two inches, but was at least three feet
across the shoulders, an immense man for his
height, his chest being as broad and hairy as a gorilla's.
His powerful legs were set wide apart to
steady himself to the ship's motion, and for a brief
instant he stood there in the full light, clothed in
his pajamas. Then, with a roar like that of a bull,
he plunged headlong for the lattice door of his
room, and, bursting it with a crash, reached the
deck in full stride. He just caught sight of what
appeared to be a skirt, switching around the corner
of the deck house, and he leaped savagely for it.
He reached the corner, swung around it&mdash;and saw
no one. Down the alleyway he ran, swung about,
and came out to port upon the deck. There was not
a soul to be seen, and he hesitated an instant which
way to run. Then he ran aft with prodigious speed,
and, within a couple of seconds, reached the cabin
companionway. The light burned at the head of the
broad stairs, but not a soul was in sight. He dashed
inside silently, being barefooted, and, peering over
the baluster, he saw the steward on watch peacefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
snoring away in a chair near the water-cooler at the
foot of the stairway.</p>

<p>"Sam!" he called sharply.</p>

<p>The man awoke with a start.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" he said, looking about him, recognizing
the captain's voice, but not seeing him at
once.</p>

<p>"Has any one come down this way within the last
few minutes?" asked Junard.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not a soul, sir."</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sir. I've only been dozing but a minute.
I'd have seen 'em, sir."</p>

<p>Junard slipped away quietly, leaving the under-steward
wondering what he wanted. With amazing
swiftness, the master rushed back to his room. He
reached it, and went inside the broken door. The
light was still burning, but the safe was now closed.
He tried the combination lock, and found it had
been locked. The gun and knife had also disappeared.
The room was in perfect order, the light
burning full power, and there was not a thing to
show that there had been an entry made. The
bursted door was the only sign of any irregularity.
He stood gazing at the safe for a few minutes. The
thing was almost uncanny. He began to wonder
if he had not had a nightmare, dreamed the whole
thing. He turned the combination of the safe, and
opened the door again. The contents of the safe
were apparently intact. He reached for the inner
drawer, where the important papers had been kept.
They were gone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>It was not nightmare, after all. The thing was
real. The papers had been taken from the safe, and
they were worth perhaps a million to the finder, if
not much more; that is, if they could be gotten out
of the ship and into the hands of those who were
antagonistic to the deal. He pondered a few minutes
more, and then decided to go on deck and stand
the next watch upon the bridge, remaining there,
with the excuse that the cape was drawing abreast
and he would take his departure from it. He decided
not to say anything to either officer. The
thing had best be kept secret, for the very existence
of the papers might imperil his company, if that existence
were known to certain parties. He hastily
dressed and went on the bridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunn, the second officer, was now on watch,
and it was about a quarter of an hour past midnight.
The cape was drawing up, and was fast approaching
the port beam. The ship was running
about sixteen knots through a smooth sea, with a
stiff northeast trade blowing almost dead ahead.</p>

<p>Junard came to where the second officer stood.
Mr. Dunn turned and spoke to him, remarking upon
the blackness of the night and the clearness of the
Cape Maysi light.</p>

<p>Captain Junard said nothing, but watched the second
officer narrowly, and tried to fathom his demeanor,
looking for some sign that might show a
knowledge of what had transpired aboard within
the past few minutes. Dunn had been upon the
bridge when that safe was shut, when the revolver
had been taken away. Yet Dunn had been in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
employ of the company for ten years, and was a
reliable man, a sailor who had always done his duty
without murmur. He had a fine record.</p>

<p>The light drew abeam, and the ship ran close to
the low, rocky point where it juts out into the sea.
The high mountains a few miles back showed dimly
in the gloom, making a huge shadow in the background.
As the light is upon the north side of the
low promontory and shows across to the southward,
the land was very near as the ship steamed past it
and laid her head for the passage.</p>

<p>Junard gazed hard at the shore. He was thinking.
Would any one try to get into communication
with Cuba here at the cape? There was a question.
If a small boat lay near, with lights out, she might
get close to the ship without being observed, for it
was quite dark, and the loom of the land made it
darker than usual. It was nearly six hours' run to
the next light, in the Bahamas, across the channel,
and the Inagua Bank was too far to the eastward
to invite shelter for a small boat. It would be either
at the cape, or near Castle Rock, or Fortune Island,
he believed, that an attempt might be made to get
into communication with the ship. This he must
stop. No one must get in communication with the
land before daylight. Then he would search every
passenger thoroughly, go through all rooms, and
take a chance at the result. At Castle Rock he
would be on watch, if nothing occurred here.</p>

<p>He gazed steadily into the blackness ahead. The
stiff trade wind blew the tops of the seas white.
They broke in whitecaps, which showed now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
then through the gloom of the night. He strained
his eyes, but nothing showed ahead. The glass
showed a dull, dark sea; there was nothing in the
line of vision within three miles&mdash;that is, nothing as
large as a whaleboat. He was sure of this. There
might be something under the dark loom of the
land, but the glass failed to show anything.</p>

<p>"You take a four-point bearing upon the light,
Mr. Dunn, and get the distance accurate," said
Junard. "The mate took his bearing before he left
the deck, but you can take another&mdash;we are about
abreast now&mdash;she's doing exactly sixteen."</p>

<p>Knowing that this would take the second officer
until the light bore four points abaft the beam,
Junard left the bridge and went aft without notice.
He slipped down to the main deck, and went along
the gangway until he reached the taffrail. The
whirl of the wheel shook the ship mightily here, the
long, steel arm of the tiller under the gratings shook
and vibrated with the pulsations. The chains drawn
taut clanked and rattled in the guides and sounded
above the low murmur of the shaking fabric. Junard
gazed over the stern and watched the thrust of
the screw as it tore the sea white and whirled a
giant stream astern that showed sickly white with
the phosphorescent glow.</p>

<p>When he turned again, he was aware of some one
watching him. A head had appeared and vanished
from behind the end of the cabin structure. The
captain sprang for it with a bound. He turned the
corner in time to see a skirt disappearing into the
alleyway leading into the saloon. He was upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
with a catlike rush. He reached the saloon door
just as it closed in his face.</p>

<p>Without hesitating an instant, he plunged against
it, and it gave way to his great weight and power.
He burst with a crash into the saloon.</p>

<p>The under steward who was on watch aft saw an
apparition of a man in uniform coming through the
door like a bull. He had opened his eyes in time to
recognize the captain, who ran right across the
cabin and out upon the deck beyond.</p>

<p>Junard was swift. He made a reach for the figure
as it flitted into a room which opened upon the
deck nearly amidships. His iron grip closed upon
the skirt, which stretched out in the wind behind
the fleeing figure. Then something struck him full
in the face, took his breath, and blinded him. He
clung to the cloth, choking, coughing, and blinded;
made a grab with his free hand to clutch the person&mdash;but
his grip closed upon empty air.</p>

<p>When he got the ammonia out of his eyes, which
were almost blinded by the scorching fluid, he hurried
to his room and bathed his head copiously in
cold water until he regained his sight.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a woman, all right," he commented.
"We'll have her all right in the morning; she won't
get a show to-night to get away with anything. I
guess I've got her measure."</p>

<p>In a few minutes he sent for the purser.</p>

<p>That individual came to the captain's room with
fear and trembling. He had been playing draw
poker, and breaking the rules of the ship, regardless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of discipline, and expected, of course, to get a

<p>"Give me the passenger list," said Junard.</p>

<p>It was produced. They ran over it, looking for
the location of all the women under thirty or thereabouts
in the ship. Junard said nothing of his adventure,
and the purser was amazed at his appearance.</p>

<p>"Had a bad night, captain?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, rather. There's a case of cholera aboard&mdash;among
the women&mdash;I don't know which one, but
we'll have a chance to find out to-morrow. Don't
speak of it to any one, mind you; don't let it out
under any conditions&mdash;you understand?"</p>

<p>"Sure not," said the purser, paling a little under
the news. "How did you come to find it out,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that now. Just keep an eye on all
the women in this ship, and don't let any of them
get to throwing things overboard, or trying to do
anything foolish. Watch them, and tell me of anything
that might happen."</p>

<p>The purser, amazed, went back to his game of
poker with certain passengers; but before doing so,
he instructed several of his force to watch both
gangways for the rest of the night. He did not
know what the "old man" expected, but supposed
that cholera patients attempted to throw things
overboard, or tried suicide. The thought of the
dread disease aboard made him forgetful of the
game, and he lost heavily before morning.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Junard, still smarting from the ammonia thrown
in his face, came again upon the bridge. He had
saved his eyes by a fraction, for the fluid had struck
him right in the nose and mouth, and only the spray
of it had gotten into his face higher up. It had
been squirted by a fluid "gun" of the kind commonly
used by bicyclists for repelling angry dogs.
Part of the skirt had remained in his grip, but the
person had slipped away in an instant and disappeared.
It angered him to think a woman could do
such a thing. And yet, if it were a woman watching
him, there was sure to be more than a woman connected
with it. No woman, he reasoned, could have
tried his safe. No woman would have taken his
revolver and carried it, along with a deadly knife.
There must have been a well-organized party to the
affair, and they had watched him, after taking the
papers, to see just what he would do. Of course,
he knew they would not toss such a valuable document
overboard in the night time without a boat being
close at hand to pick it up. The ocean is a hard
place to find anything at night. He knew now that
they were aware of his watchfulness and would not
attempt to get rid of the papers except under the
most favorable conditions. To throw them overboard
attached to anything small enough not to attract
attention would be to invite sure loss. He
reasoned this out as he stood out the rest of Mr.
Dunn's watch, and at eight bells&mdash;four o'clock in
the morning&mdash;the mate came again on the bridge
without anything happening to excite him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>"I've been on deck for a short time, Mr. Jameson,"
said Junard; "but I'm going to turn in for a
little while. Call me when we get well up to Castle
Rock&mdash;we'll raise it before morning, before daylight
with the weather clear like this."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir; I will, sir&mdash;she's doing fine now,"
said Jameson, as he signed the order book for his
course during his watch.</p>

<p>At two bells&mdash;five o'clock&mdash;the mate called the
captain by going to his port door and knocking. He
was amazed at the sight of a young woman who
came forth from the room and whisked herself
quickly down the deck and out of sight. Such a
thing as a woman in the master's room at that hour
was enough to excite Mr. Jameson. He had not
been on the ship long, and the captain was new to
him. Masters naturally had love affairs as well as
sailors, but they were generally careful about being
caught. Here Junard had asked him to call him
when they sighted Castle Rock, and, as he knew
they must do this by five, at least, the mate was
puzzled to see a woman leaving the captain's room
when he knocked. Why hadn't she left sooner? It
was a joke he would be bound to retail to the rest
sooner or later, and he smiled at the thought. He
tried to get a glimpse of her face, but failed. Then
he waited a decent length of time, and knocked
again, louder, announcing the light ahead on the
starboard bow.</p>

<p>Junard came on deck instantly. He had been
dressed and dozing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>The gray light of the morning, which was now
beginning to show things a little, enabled Junard to
note the smile upon the face of his chief mate.</p>

<p>"Anything funny doing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir; but I seen her&mdash;I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"Seen who?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir; but she was just going
out when I came to call you when I raised the light&mdash;your
orders, sir, you know. I wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out with it! Whom did you see?" snapped the
captain sharply, and his tone told plainly that he
was in no mood for a joke. The mate sobered at
once.</p>

<p>"There was a lady leaving your room as I came
to knock&mdash;that's all, sir," he said sullenly. The
captain had a poor appreciation of humor, he
thought.</p>

<p>"What kind of looking woman was she?"</p>

<p>"Medium-sized, very well built&mdash;I might say
stocky, sir&mdash;dressed in a dark cloth dress; she didn't
have on a hat." This last was with almost a sneer.
It brought Junard around with a jerk.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to seem foolish, Mr. Jameson, but
you appear to presume too much. I might insinuate
gently that you are a damn fool&mdash;but I won't, not
until you tell me what is amusing you, and what you
saw. I will say there was no woman in my room.
If there was, I'd not be troubled to confess it."</p>

<p>"That's all I seen, sir," said Jameson sourly.</p>

<p>"Which way did she go?"</p>

<p>"She went aft," said the mate, wondering at the
captain trying to hide the obvious. It irked him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
think his master a fool. "She went aft, and that's
all I seen."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jameson, there's a few things you don't
know," said Junard. "When we get abreast of
Castle Rock, I want you to go aft and watch both
sides of the ship carefully, you understand? I want
you to see that not a thing is thrown overboard&mdash;not
a single thing&mdash;and if there is anything showing
in the wake, come to me at once&mdash;or, better still,
ring off the engines and mark it to pick up. This is
very important. I can't tell you right now just how
important it is, but I will say your berth depends
upon it. Do not let anything leave the ship without
notice&mdash;not a thing."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," said Jameson; and he went aft
amazed at the outcome of his deductions. He wondered
what was up. Some affair of the captain's,
he was sure. But the severity of the master's tone,
the earnestness of the captain's manner, disturbed
him greatly. There was something peculiar about
it that made him, forced him, to give his attention
to it. And there was the threat of his own berth,
his position, being in forfeit. He did not like that
kind of talk from a captain. It savored of undue
severity. He took his station aft of the superstructure
with some misgivings. In the gray light of
dawn, he watched both gangways, first one side and
then the other, keeping well back of the house.</p>

<p>Castle Rock light drew well upon the bow. It
was now within a mile, and Junard noticed a small
fishing boat riding in the fairway just ahead of the
ship. As the water was very deep here, he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
she was not anchored, but must be waiting and
under way; yet no sail showed upon her. Perhaps
a powerful motor lay within her. He watched her
carefully, and walked from side to side of the
bridge, waiting for some sign from those aboard.
The wake was now showing white in the gray of
morning, and a small object could soon be distinguished
in the smooth sea to leeward of the lighthouse,
where the heavy swell of the Atlantic was
cut off.</p>

<p>Jameson, who stood at the taffrail, saw a figure
of a man peer from the window of a stateroom
nearly amidships. The head was quickly withdrawn.
The mate watched, and then walked quickly
across the stern and watched the wake, wondering
what might be taking place. The form of a woman
flitted down the gangway from forward, showing
dimly in the gloom. She came from the opposite
side of the ship from where he had seen the head
peer forth. Hiding behind the house, he watched
her come quickly aft. She was carrying something
in her hand that looked like a life buoy. Instinctively
the mate made ready to catch her. He saw
that life belt, and to his imagination it spelled something
like a person going overboard. The form of
a man came quickly behind her, and Jameson recognized
one of the under stewards, who had been
watching for trouble at the purser's orders.</p>

<p>The woman ran at the sound of footsteps behind
her. She came with amazing swiftness to the taffrail,
near where Jameson stood. He gathered himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and sprang forth, clasping her in his arms just
as she hurled the life belt over the side into the sea.</p>

<p>The girl screamed shrilly, struggled frantically in
the embrace of the officer. Jameson wondered what
he was about&mdash;began to think he had captured a
lunatic&mdash;when the rush of feet above caused him to
loosen his grip. He turned in time to see Captain
Junard take a header from the rail of the deck
above and plunge headlong into the sea where it
boiled and swirled from the thrust of the screw.</p>

<p>Jameson was paralyzed for an instant. He distinctly
saw his commander go overboard. It gave
him a shock. He let go the girl and stood motionless
for a second. Then, as the head of Junard
arose in the white waste astern and struck out for
an object, the life belt the girl had thrown over, he
gathered his wits again, and dashed for the quarter
bell pull, or telegraph, to the engine room.</p>

<p>Full speed astern he threw it, and the astonished
engineer on watch nearly fainted under the sudden
warning. Thinking that a collision was at hand, he
shut down and reversed under full power, opening
the throttle wide, and giving her every ounce of
steam in her boilers as she took the strain. The
sudden take-up, the tremendous vibrations, and the
slowing speed awoke many passengers. Not a
sound of action had gone forth save the screams
of the girl, and these were now silent as she had
quickly flitted out of sight when the mate released
her. Jameson rushed to the bridge and called his
watch as he ran. Then he set the siren cord down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
hard, and the unearthly roar awoke the quiet tropical
morning. Men rushed about. The watch hurried
aft.</p>

<p>"Stop her!" yelled Jameson to the quartermaster.
"Stop her&mdash;don't go astern!"</p>

<p>"Stop her, sir!" came the answering cry from the
wheel. Jameson rushed to the rail again, and cut
loose a life buoy from its lashings. He ran aft with
it, intending to throw it out to his captain. Junard,
however, was but a speck, far astern, his head showing
like a black dot in the white water of the wake.
The mate noticed for the first time that the small
fishing boat ahead was now standing down toward
the ship under rapid headway, the exhaust from her
motor sounding loud and sharp over the sea.</p>

<p>"Get the quarter boat down&mdash;quick!" came his
order.</p>

<p>Then he hesitated a moment. The small fishing
boat was nearing them with rapidity. She headed
straight for Junard, and would reach him long before
any rowboat from the ship could get there.</p>

<p>"Hold on! Avast the boat there!" he ordered.
"That motor boat will pick him up, all right." Then
the thought that he was not quite right in not lowering
down a boat for his commander, that it might
look queer, waiting for a stranger to do his evident
duty, came over him, and he gave the order to lower
away. The small boat dropped into the sea. The
steamer was now motionless, lying in the calm sea
behind the rock, with her engines stopped. Men
crowded the rail aft to watch.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What made him jump overboard?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
came the question from all sides. "It's the
captain! What's up?"</p>

<p>Jameson could not quite tell. He was vaguely
aware that his commander sprang over for some object.
That he took a desperate chance, with the
ship going ahead, was certain. Had he not been
seen, the vessel would have been miles away before
missing him, for there had been no warning from
the bridge. The mate slid down the falls, wondering
what he was doing.</p>

<p>"Cast off&mdash;give way, port; back, starboard!"
came his order. He stood up, to see better, and
gazed at the fishing boat, that now approached the
speck he knew to be the head of Captain Junard.</p>

<p>"Give way together!" he said, glad to get away
from the ship, with the inquisitive crowd gathering
rapidly and increasing in both anxiety and numbers.</p>

<p>He watched the motor boat come quickly to where
Junard swam. The captain was not a good swimmer.
Few seamen can swim well. Jameson saw
the boat approach, men lean out from her side, and
grab something, apparently trying to lift the captain
aboard. Then there was a tremendous floundering
and threshing about in the sea, distant shouts for
help from the captain, and the mate grasped the
tiller yoke with a certain grip.</p>

<p>"Give way, bullies! Give way&mdash;all that's in you
now!" he urged.</p>

<p>Something was taking place that he did not quite
understand, but he had heard that call for help.</p>

<p>Junard saw the fishing boat coming toward him
before it reached him. He waited, swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
slowly and reserving his strength, feeling that the
occupants were hostile and were waiting for the
papers that had been tossed overboard. It was
about where he expected something to happen. The
lighthouse and the shelter of the island made it a
most convenient spot to pull off the finish of the
affair. The light-draft fishing boat, with her motor,
could easily evade capture from anything the ship
could send out after her. The steamer herself could
not enter the shoal water, and must allow the
smaller boat to get away across the shallow parts of
the Great Panama Bank to some distant rendezvous,
where the papers could be put aboard a proper ship
to take them to the conspirators. He, the commander,
had no right to leave the ship in the manner
he had done; but necessity called for drastic
action, and he had plunged over the side as soon as
he had seen the girl fling an object overboard.</p>

<p>Three men in the fishing boat were watching him
as she drew up. His own boat was a long distance
off, but he hoped the mate would hurry.</p>

<p>A man came forward in the motor boat, and
leaned out from her side. He watched him narrowly.
The man made a grab for Junard as the
boat reached him, and the captain, with a sudden
jerk, dragged him overboard. Then he yelled for
help.</p>

<p>The man's two companions in the boat sprang to
his aid. Junard found himself engaged in a desperate
struggle with three men, and shoved himself
away from the side of the craft.</p>

<p>He held fast to the package, a metal cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
tightly wrapped in canvas, and at the same time
struggled out of reach of the men above him. The
man he had pulled overboard regained his strength,
and, grasping the life belt with one hand, grabbed
at the package with the other. The package tied to
the life belt could not be gotten out of his reach,
and Junard was struggling with one hand and fighting
and grasping alternately at the life belt with the
other.</p>

<p>"Give it up, you scoundrel!" hissed the fellow.
"What do you know about this package? Give it
to me&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

<p>"I hear well enough," snarled Junard, struggling
farther out of the reach of those in the motor boat.
"But I'm the captain of that ship there&mdash;and the
papers are in my care. Let go, or I'll do you
harm!"</p>

<p>The man glared at him savagely. Then he turned
to the men above him in the boat, now a dozen feet
away.</p>

<p>"Shoot, Jim&mdash;shoot quick&mdash;kill the fool if he
won't let go!" he said.</p>

<p>The man addressed was a tall, dark fellow with
a sinister look. That he was Colombian, Junard
knew from his accent and appearance. The other,
who had stopped the engine, and who seemed to be
the engineer, looked askance. He evidently did not
like the shooting part. This man was also a Colombian,
but his features were those of a man who
works outdoors at a simple trade. The other two
looked like desperate men, and Junard felt that they
would stop at nothing to get the papers from him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
The man who was called Jim hesitated, and then,
seeing the small boat approaching from the steamer,
reached behind his back and brought forth a long,
blue revolver. Junard waited until the barrel came
within a line with his eye; then he ducked, and
swung the life belt around, coming up with it in
front of him, and raising it partly before his face.
The pistol cracked sharply, and the bullet tore
through the cork. Junard let go the package, and
seized the man in the water with both hands, whirling
him about and holding him squarely in front of
himself.</p>

<p>"Start that engine!" called the man, struggling
vainly to get away.</p>

<p>The man who had stopped it whirled the wheel
over again, and the rumble of the motor began.
The two waited, without throwing on the clutch.</p>

<p>Junard grasped the man firmly, and forced him
down under the sea, going under with him, and
holding his breath to the limit of his great lungs.</p>

<p>When he came up again the man was choking,
gasping for air. Junard only waited long enough
to fill his own lungs with a breath, and then ducked
again, the crack of the revolver ringing in his ears
as he went, pulling his antagonist down with him.</p>

<p>The next time he came up the fellow could not
talk, but choked and gasped for air. Junard held
him with a giant's grip, his long, powerful arms
encircling him like those of a gorilla. The fellow
let go the life belt and the package. Junard took
in more air, and dropped down again, while a bullet
tore through his hair, cutting his scalp.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>This time when he came up the fellow was limp.
Junard held him before him, and the man with the
pistol was afraid to fire, as the captain's eyes just
showed above the man's neck. The captain struggled
farther and farther away from the boat, getting
fully twenty feet distant. The man at the engine
threw on the clutch, and the boat shot ahead,
swung sharply around, and headed for the floating
men.</p>

<p>Junard saw the mate standing up in the stern of
the ship's boat, and knew he was doing all he could
to reach him. The shots had made him aware of
the desperate situation, and the men were bending
their backs with a will to the oars. Jameson yelled
harshly, the men in the motor craft saw that to remain
longer would mean capture. They swung off
and headed for the steamer, leaving their companion
in Junard's grip. The next moment the mate
came tearing up, and, leaning over, grasped his
commander and hauled him aboard the boat.</p>

<p>Junard came over the side, and immediately
reached for a boat hook. He stabbed at the cork
jacket, and hauled it alongside, dragging it aboard
before the boat lost her headway. The body of the
exhausted man sank before either he or Jameson
could get another hold of him.</p>

<p>"To the ship&mdash;quick!" gasped the captain.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What's up?" questioned the
mate.</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;swing her, quick!"</p>

<p>The boat turned around and headed back, the
captain urging the men to their utmost. The fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
boat, with her motor going full speed, left them
far behind. They were unable to get near the craft.</p>

<p>Junard, watching them, saw the boat come close
under the ship's stern. A form of a woman leaped
from the rail of the lower deck. The splash threw
spray almost into the boat as she went past, and
they saw the tall Colombian reach over and drag the
girl aboard. The boat shot around the steamer's
stern and disappeared for a few moments; and when
Junard saw her again she was a quarter of a mile
distant, and making rapid headway for the shoal
water of the island. He started after her, when the
shots from the revolver began to strike about the
craft, and Junard ordered his men to stop rowing.
He knew he could not capture her, unarmed as he
was, and he had his precious papers safe in his
mighty hands. To follow was only to invite
trouble.</p>

<p>The fishing boat ran quickly out of range, and
Junard watched her for a few minutes. Then he
headed his boat back to the ship.</p>

<p>The rail was crowded as he came alongside, the
purser watching him, and half the passengers were
on deck to see what was taking place.</p>

<p>"What was it? What's the matter?" asked a
score at once.</p>

<p>"Man overboard&mdash;that's all," said Jameson.</p>

<p>"H'ist her up," said Junard, and he clambered up
the swinging ladder thrown over to him, taking the
life belt and the package under his arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunn was on deck, and Junard gave him his
orders.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>"Full speed ahead&mdash;on her course, north to
west," he said, and went into his room. The door
closed behind him. Then he switched off the lights,
for it was now broad daylight, and then he opened
the package. The papers were all there and intact,
the water not reaching them at all. The safe was
opened, and they were placed within. Then Junard
stripped and turned in for a few hours of dreamless,
quiet sleep.</p>

<p>He had saved the papers of his company, documents
that were valued at more than a million dollars&mdash;and
not a soul aboard knew what had really
happened. Even Jameson was never quite sure.</p>

<p>The purser asked no questions about cholera, the
ship headed along upon her course toward New
York, and the warm day took its routine without
further incident. Junard appeared very happy,
and told many interesting stories at the dinner table
that day. He answered no questions concerning the
affair of the night.</p>

<p>He brought in his papers, delivered them in person,
and a great political change took place without
any one but a few select souls ever knowing how
near the verge of revolution a prominent South
American republic had been. Junard was offered
a medal for risking his life trying to save that of a
man overboard&mdash;but he refused it. The shots from
the fishing boat were explained as signals for help.
That was all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IN THE WAKE OF THE ENGINE</h2></div>


<p>I had been transferred to the old <i>Prince Albert</i>,
one of the freighters on the Jamaica
run, and the skipper was Bill Boldwin&mdash;Boldwin
who was once in the Amper Line, but who
had a monstrous thirst and a reckless disposition&mdash;too
reckless for first-class passengers. The
"old man," as all captains are called, having these
failings, had also a mighty poor education, and
his navigation was mostly, "Let her go and trust
to the sun."</p>

<p>"Compasses?" said Bill. "How'd they get along
before they had 'em, hey? Steer the course, or
thereabouts; you'll git thar or somewheres nigh to
it&mdash;if you don't fetch up."</p>

<p>"But the company?" I said in amazement.</p>

<p>"The company be blowed! Take life easy&mdash;it's
short. Don't let the company worry you to any
great extent. They'll give you a job as night
watchman at twenty per month after they get out
of you all there is in you."</p>

<p>At the same time Bill, who was my "old man,"
and who, by the way, was ten years younger than
myself, would not stand for any too much carelessness
on the part of his first officer. I was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
chief mate. He knew what I had to do, and hated
to tell me. I confess I seldom gave him a chance.
The second greaser was a little, short squarehead
named Andersen; at least we called him that, going
on the principle that it was a sure thing that
if he was a squarehead he was either named Andersen
or Johnson. There are no other names in
Sweden, and a man naturally just has to be one
or the other. They're good enough.</p>

<p>Andersen knew his business and was an able
seaman, learning his little book in the old sailing
ships where they teach you something not always
taught in steam. He had the bos'n in with him,
and what the bos'n didn't know about handling
the steam winches would be hard to tell. But that's
all the bos'n knew. Not a thing else. If he had
he wouldn't have rammed greasy rags in behind
the ceiling of the after deck house in a hurry to
get his grub at knock-off time.</p>

<p>No, that was the failing of the bos'n; he lacked
knowledge, and was as good a navigator as you
might find in a young lady's finishing school. He
had paws on him like a loggerhead's flippers,
nearly a foot across, and each finger was a marline
spike, and every thread of his hair, where he wasn't
clean bald, was a rope yarn. He knew sailoring&mdash;nothing
else.</p>

<p>He was about as much afraid of anything in this
world or the next as a hungry shark is of beef; in
fact, he seemed to take to trouble with about the
same sort of appetite. In six months I never had
a chance to tell him anything except the routine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>The chief engineer was McDougal, and the second
was Mac something&mdash;all of our engine-room
force went under the same name of Mac, just
plain "<i>Mac</i>," and if they were not Scotchmen, I
never saw one in my life. Scotchmen are born
engine men, take to a machine like a dago does to
a knife. The rest of the fireroom bunch were
the old-style Liverpool Irishmen, and I'll tell you
something, they were hard ones all right. They
were the toughest lot of coal tossers I ever sailed
with, and even the donkey man, O'Hare, was a
peach of a Donegal Irishman with Galways of reddish
hue that stuck out from under his shirt collar,
pointing upward as if they were growing some
husky on his throat.</p>

<p>That was the principal part of our crew. There
were some twenty others, including the cooks, galley
boys, seamen, and quartermasters.</p>

<p>We cleared for Antonio, and were soon running
out over the Western Ocean in the lazy, tiresome
routine of ship's duty. We were licensed to carry
passengers and had a few waiters aboard, a steward,
and a lady of about thirty signed on as stewardess.</p>

<p>As there were no passengers this voyage out&mdash;no
one ever went out with us if he could help it,
but came back when there were no other ships&mdash;the
cabin crowd had an easy time, regular yachting
trip; and if Miss Lucy Docking had a stupid time,
it was because she wouldn't talk to the rest.</p>

<p>"Stuck-up and sassy," they said aft, but I never
could tell, never getting a chance to talk with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
without a dozen or more listening. At the same
time I didn't like to blame the girl just because she
didn't like the set of lovers the ship furnished free
of charge. "Let her pick her own," said I, "it's like
enough she'll make a mistake, anyways, without
your help." I never had a big opinion of women,
anyhow, for the only one I ever proposed marriage
to fell down and nearly died laughing at me, and
that after I had been dreaming of her and thinking
her the greatest angel in the world.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy was all right with me, because I let
her alone, except in the mid-watch, when I was
cold and thirsty. Then she used to get me a cup
of cocoa or chocolate or coffee, and I tell you the
man who stands the mid-watch on the old freighters
is earning all he gets, whether it comes by way of
the stewardess or by way of the front office.</p>

<p>We crossed the Western Ocean in the usual manner.
I had my order book to sign, and I saw that
the second greaser didn't get gay with it. Days
and days of the old routine passed, and we were
in the edge of the trade when the first thing happened
to show what a wild lot of yaps we had in
that ship.</p>

<p>The bos'n stuffed his oiled rags in behind the
ceiling of the after house, and it was about three
days afterward we struck the hot weather. The
rags promptly caught fire&mdash;they always do when
snugged in from the air&mdash;and we hove the old
hooker to in the teeth of the trade with the after
deck a roaring furnace. If you think we didn't
have a time of it putting that deck house out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
throwing it overboard in pieces, you should look up
Lloyd's. Well, the way I talked to that bos'n
would have given heart disease to most men, but
the beggar didn't see it at all.</p>

<p>"Rags is rags," he says, "and what for don't I
put them behaind something?"</p>

<p>"Because if you do it again we'll toss you overboard
with twenty pound of kentledge to your
feet," I told him, and it was the only reason he
could get through his bullet head. It didn't scare
him at all. He only looked upon the matter as
closed, for he would not mutiny. He was too
good a sailor for any foolishness.</p>

<p>"Rags is rags," he would repeat as we chopped
the blackened wreck away the day after, when all
hands had been near the port of missing ships and
were tired and nervous, having been on duty for
fifty hours without a break. "Rags is rags, an'
some son of a sea-cook set fire to 'em&mdash;no rags I
ever seen ever took fire of themselves. Does a
ship run herself, hey? Answer me that! Does a
ship run her own engines, steer her own course,
what? Some one of you sons of Ham did that
dirty trick and I'll get you for it yet!"</p>

<p>"But rags do fire themselves, even if a ship
don't," said the old man, "and you are the leading
bonehead not to know it. You don't rate a brass
boy in anything but a coal barge, and if you don't
look out I'll have to train you some."</p>

<p>"Rags is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Only the size and look of the bos'n's hands prevented
the old man from committing murder right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
there. But the bos'n took it out on the men. What
he didn't do to them that voyage was never logged.</p>

<p>Miss Docking stood the test well. She stayed on
deck and watched the fracas and never turned a
hair, so to speak, waiting for the word to take to
the boats with as cool a nerve as anything I ever
saw. She was billeted for my boat, Number One,
and I confess I was somewhat disappointed when
the blamed deck house burned to the steel and the
danger of leaving the ship was past.</p>

<p>Boldwin was always taking it easy, and he never
even took that real hard, although it would cost
him something to explain how he did the damage
when the underwriters asked him.</p>

<p>"Don't do it again," was all he said to me.</p>

<p>"No, not until we get another deck house at
least," I said. "Maybe I can see that they don't
set fire to the anchor or burn up the windlass, or
eat the coir hawser, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, see that you don't. That's your business&mdash;you're
mate," he snapped back, and started for
the chart house.</p>

<p>Andersen came to me. "I tank I sign de order
book for sou'west half sou'&mdash;here we bane running
eastb'no'th. How I tell de truth wid sech a t'ing&mdash;hey?"
said he.</p>

<p>"If you always tell the truth in this line of packets
you'll soon get a job hoeing potatoes in Essex!
What's the matter with you? Do you want the
company to get wise that we fought a fire set in
with oiled rags by a fool of a bos'n and had to run
the ship fifty miles off her course? Who'll pay for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the coal? Who'll square the old man? Who'll tell
the passengers that we don't always have a bonehead
bos'n to wreck us, and that if they'll promise
to come again we'll see that it don't happen often&mdash;no,
not often?"</p>

<p>Andersen went on duty with a queer look in his
eyes. He had seen something and it amazed him&mdash;just
why I never could tell, for he had been in
steamers before and ought to have known something
of a ship's officers' duties before coming into
the Prince Line.</p>

<p>The truth in many lines is sacred. Absolutely
sacred. Too sacred entirely to shift about the deck
like a bag of dunnage and leave lying around for
some fools to play with. No, never play with the
truth in some lines of shipping. Do your duty.
That's all you've got to do, and if it's so logged,
why, then you're all right. If it isn't, why, then
you better get to driving a truck or peddling peanuts.</p>

<p>Well, Boldwin was a pretty good sort, as I have
said. He mostly saw that all of us did our duty&mdash;in
the log book, in the order book, and with the
company officers. We went along slowly on our
course after that, and were in the latitude of Watlings
when bad weather came on. It was nothing
much, just a cyclone of the usual order, coming
as it did in the hurricane season; but we were a
full-powered ship of six thousand tons, and it
wouldn't have delayed us to any extent&mdash;except
that we didn't count on the donkey man from
Donegal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>You see, the <i>Albert</i> had one of those underwater
ash-chutes. The pipe came down through
the bilge, about fifteen feet below the water line.
It was a foot in diameter, and was supposedly
bolted to the skin and as solid as the keel or garboards.</p>

<p>The metal of the pipe was half an inch in thickness,
and was braced and bolted so that the top
which showed above the water line could be hove
on and shut off in a seaway. The top had a sliding
cover working with a lever, and when the ashes
were to be fired out the cover was thrown back, the
bucket dumped, and a jet of steam blew the mass
out through the ship's bottom, making no dirt or
dust at all, and doing away with the everlasting
firing over the side.</p>

<p>It was a good invention. It saved the company
many dollars in paint, and it kept the ship, which
was always short-handed, looking better than most
vessels that used the old way over the side.</p>

<p>It would have lasted forever if the man from
Donegal hadn't been of an inquisitive turn of mind,
and started exploring it with a monkey wrench
the week before the storm. As it happened he
broke several of the bolts which had rusted in the
bottom, and the metal, having been much worn and
corroded, the first thing Mac knew was a torrent
of sea water pouring into the after compartment,
coming as it did through a pipe hole about a foot
in diameter and fifteen feet below the sea level.</p>

<p>It caught the firemen unawares. The donkey
man was with them and let out a yip that brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
every coal passer, oiler, and fireman to the chute.
A wild burst of water tore through that hole, and
the compartment was flooded in less time than it
takes to tell about it&mdash;and that compartment ran
the whole length of the engine room and aft of it
until it brought up in the wake of the machinery,
where the bulkhead of the tail-shaft room shut off
the stern.</p>

<p>The donkey man managed to get out with the
rest, and the fires in starboard boilers swamped,
nearly blowing up the ship as the water flooded
them. It was only because there was enough water
to prevent the making of steam to any great extent
that saved us from having the whole midsection
blown in the air.</p>

<p>And all the time I was holding to the bridge rail
with a cyclone snoring down upon us at the rate
of seventy miles an hour. Luckily the ash pipe
stayed partly bolted to the skin of the bottom.
That alone saved us from total loss.</p>

<p>Of course I knew something was wrong the minute
the boilers went smothered. The terrific roar
of steam and the easing of the engines told me
that sure enough trouble was coming, and all the
time I had been wondering how we would hold the
hooker up to that gale with the full power in her.</p>

<p>"What's the matter&mdash;bottom blow away?"
howled Boldwin, coming from the pilot house and
yelling in my ear.</p>

<p>"God knows&mdash;anything might happen to us after
last week," I howled in return, but the force of the
hurricane blew the words away, and the old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
went staggering and pulling himself along the rail
until he managed to get below. For the next fifteen
minutes on that bridge I did some small bit
of thinking. Looked like all day with us. Not a
sign could I get from anywhere, and of course I
dared not leave the bridge. Once I thought she
had blown up with powder. Next I thought the
engines had gone through the bottom. And all
the time I could feel her settling in that whirlwind
sea&mdash;a sea torn white with the blast of the squalls
that were now coming faster and faster each
minute.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm mighty glad I'm not married, anyway,"
I said to myself, for it looked like the long
sleep coming fast. And then I somehow thought of
that Miss Docking below there in the comfortable
cabin waiting for the finish. It gave me a bit
of a turn, and I tried to imagine what that cabin
would look like in a few minutes when the sea
water swept through it with all its transoms and
cushions, piano and carpet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hard a starboard, sir," came the cry.</p>

<p>It was most welcome. Anything but that standing
there waiting for the next minute to follow the
last. I saw that the quartermaster swung the wheel
over quickly. It was steam steering, and the ship
fell off in the trough of the sea in a few minutes,
the weight of the gale driving her bodily to leeward
and heeling her over to quite a list.</p>

<p>"Heave her to," came the order passed up from
the old man, and I put the wheel hard down and
waited to see if she would stay without coming up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
She lay easily drifting off, and while I watched
her for trouble the old man sent for me. Andersen
came up and took my place, and I ran down, half
blown, half crawling to the shelter of the deck
house, and from there below to see what had happened.</p>

<p>Bill Boldwin was standing at the ash chute
swearing at the man from Donegal. The donkey
man was trying to tell what he didn't know about
his business, and all the time the water flowed freely
through the one-foot pipe until it so filled the compartment
that nothing more could come up through
it. It was a good thing! If the whole Atlantic
Ocean had been delegated to flow through that
pipe, nobody was there to stop it, not a soul to say
why not. And then I was aware of the stewardess
standing in the press of faces, looking scared but
cool.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ram something in it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Simple? Sure it was simple. No one had tried
to do such a thing, but there she was asking why.</p>

<p>"The pipe'll break away&mdash;you can't shove anything
down it," said Boldwin.</p>

<p>"No? But why don't you shove something from
the outside?" said Miss Docking.</p>

<p>"Go to your room," snarled the old man.</p>

<p>"She's right&mdash;we'll stop it in a jiffy&mdash;from the
outside," I yelled.</p>

<p>The skipper thought I was crazy. He looked at
me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>"How'll you get anything over the outside in this
seaway, you bonehead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Get me the hand lead," I yelled to the bos'n,
"and a stick of light wood&mdash;big piece, big enough
to float a man."</p>

<p>The bos'n ran for the stuff. That was one good
point in that bos'n. He'd do what he was told
even when he hadn't the slightest idea what he
was doing. He came back in a few minutes with
a long piece of white pine and the hand lead. I
looked them over for a moment to judge the weight
and floating power of the tools. Then I quickly
hitched the lead to the piece of pine and left the
bight of the line so that as soon as I jerked it
hard the lead would free itself and go hell bent for
Davy Jones, leaving the Pine line fast to the lead
line to float up and away.</p>

<p>To the end of the chute I now quickly made my
way. The Donegal man wanted to help, and faith!
he was a good man when it came to doing things
he understood. He showed me where the upper
end of that chute was in that roaring surge of filthy
water, and the beggar actually got a hold of the
lever that worked the cover and jammed it open.</p>

<p>I instantly dropped the lead, the wood, and the
line through, and had the satisfaction of feeling the
line going fast to the bottom out through the hole
in the bilge. When the line had gone about ten
fathoms I gave the sudden jerk. Off comes the
lead and the line stops running out.</p>

<p>"Get to windward and grab that plank," I yelled,
and even the old man followed the bunch that struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to the rail and watched the sea where we
drifted bodily off. In a minute the bos'n saw it.
In five more he had the plank back aboard and a
three-inch line fast to the lead line. This I hauled
quickly but cautiously back through the ash pipe
until I got a good hold of the end.</p>

<p>"Now," I yelled, "give me mattresses, beds, canvas,
fearnaught, or oakum&mdash;anything so long as
you get it here quick."</p>

<p>The stewardess had already anticipated my work.
I caught her eye back of the line of men.</p>

<p>"Here they are," she said quietly.</p>

<p>The bos'n got a Number Double O hatch cover.
I wrapped the mattresses in it, and then quickly
hitched the three-inch line carefully about the
middle.</p>

<p>"Over the side with it," I shouted. Over it went,
and as it did so I got the line hauling through the
pipe. Two men helped me. We hauled the plug
jam up tight against the ship's bilge, and then
surged upon the line and made it fast.</p>

<p>"Now go ahead and pump her clear, Mac, pump
her out&mdash;she's tight as a drum," I said, and the old
man looked at me with a peculiar smile.</p>

<p>An hour later that compartment was clear of
water, and she leaked only a little around the stuffing,
which was not enough to wet a man's feet.
Another day and the starboard boilers were doing
duty with a smoothing sea and a sun peeping out
through the banks of trade clouds. The storm had
long passed; the <i>Prince Albert</i> was on her way under
full power, with nothing at all to disturb the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
serenity of the passage, save the knowledge that
we had a masterly crew aboard and some excellent
specimens for manning passenger ships.</p>

<p>Down the Western Ocean we ran without
further incident, and hove to off the entrance of
Antonio, burning flares for the pilot. You know
the place. Narrow cut in through the reef, with
the harbor lying like a pool of blue water in the
surrounding hills. Not a breath of air in the place
even when, half a mile distant, just outside, the
trade might be blowing a twenty-knot breeze.</p>

<p>The pilot came out at daybreak, and we ran in,
tied up to the wharf, and began discharging. My
duties were ended for the time, as I thought, and I
took a stroll up to the hotel upon the hill. There
was no use trying to get any sleep in the watch
below while at the dock, for two hundred howling
Jamaica blacks roared and surged along the gangways
and crowded the winches, handling the cargo
ably, while the women came down in swarms to
chat with the crew and sell a few grapefruit and
oranges. Boldwin let any one come aboard, and
as the men were not supposed to handle cargo, they
had plenty of time in spite of all we could do to
keep them busy.</p>

<p>The skipper reported the damage to the agents,
and told of the disaster below. He was honest.
He might have saved that bit of knowledge until
we reached England again, but he told his tale, and
the agents refused to allow him to sail until the
pipe was repaired and properly bolted down into
the bilge plates as it should be. In the smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
water of that mirror-like harbor it seemed an easy
thing to do. All that was necessary was to get a
diver to go under the fifteen feet to the outside end
and pass up the bolts through the flange.</p>

<p>Mr. Man from Donegal could then get at them
with his monkey wrench and screw down the nuts
upon them, clamping the pipe as fast as the keel
itself.</p>

<p>"You take a look around uptown and try to get
hold of a diver," said the old man. "Mr. Sacks, the
agent, says he don't know of any nearer than
Kingston, and it'll take two days to get the one
over there, as he's out on a wreck off the harbor.
We can't wait two days. Got to get to Montego
Bay and take on a lot of stuff, then get to Kingston
for clearing and off we go."</p>

<p>"Why not wait until we get to Kingston to do
the trick?" I asked.</p>

<p>Bill Boldwin gazed at me in contempt.</p>

<p>"Say, do you want to advertise the fact that we are
on the bum to all the passengers the line'll carry?
Think a minute, man, and don't ask fool questions.
We got to get that job done right here&mdash;see? We
don't go outside until there's something more'n a
mattress and a bit of fearnaught between us and
the bottom of the Caribbean."</p>

<p>"But we carried it the last thousand miles all
right," I said.</p>

<p>Bill turned away in disgust.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I didn't like the idea of trying
to get hold of a diver in Antonio. There were
not enough divers to go down to find the bottoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of the rum bottles ashore, let alone a ship's bilge.
It's true, a man might do the thing naked in that
clear water. I've seen men in the East copper a
ship twice as deep with nothing on them but a
hammer and a mouthful of nails.</p>

<p>After a day's search I gave it up. Not a man
knew anything about submarine work, and at the
hotel they laughed at me when I inquired for a
diver. I also noticed that Miss Lucy Docking looked
well sitting upon the veranda of the joint, togged
out as she was in white linen. She gave me a nod,
but wasn't keen on talking when I tried to find out
if she had made arrangements for lady passengers
that voyage.</p>

<p>"There's two on the books&mdash;that's all," she said,
and gazed placidly out over the tops of the cocoa-nuts
growing upon the beach below.</p>

<p>"Your advice last Friday helped me a lot," I
said, "and I appreciate it and would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you like some more?" she interrupted
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Anything you might suggest," I said.</p>

<p>"Beat it back to the ship, then," she answered
without a smile.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;if that's your advice," I snarled; "the hot
weather has evidently soured your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it out&mdash;I'm not a guest here, and what do
you think the agents would say if they saw the
chief officer of their 'crack' liner talking to their
stewardess sitting on the hotel piazza? I thought
you had more sense."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>"I ain't the only fool aboard&mdash;that's straight,"
I said.</p>

<p>"No; nor ashore, either&mdash;why don't you stop that
hole yourself? You're big enough and ugly enough
to stop a clock," she snapped.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" I answered, and strode away with the
kindest feelings imaginable for our stewardess.</p>

<p>But strange as it may seem, that remark was
what did the business. I would stop that hole if I
had to be keelhauled myself to do it. What! Lay
the ship up a day or two while that lady sat around
in white duck and looked out dreamily over that
beautiful harbor? Not if I knew myself. I'd see
that the ship got away and hoped she would carry
at least two ugly and indignant aged ladies who
could and would make life a happy dream for that
stewardess.</p>

<p>I went back aboard with the report that there
was not a diver this side of hell, and that if the
ship would stand the expense of my funeral I would
at least try to pass the bolts for the man from
Donegal to screw fast.</p>

<p>"Sink a donkey man, anyhow!" I swore, "why
don't the company get engineers enough to run a
ship properly?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed?" smiled Bill Boldwin.</p>

<p>I turned to the men I needed, and with that
bos'n to give them advice with those flippers of his,
I peeled off and made ready for the work. The engine-room
force had taken off the pipe and bolted
a new flange to it, a strong job and proper. The
affair was all ready to ship just as soon as we dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
pull the wad of stuffing away and set it up. A
frame had been rigged in the room to steady the
affair, and the bolt holes had been reamed out as
much as they would stand. A deck pump kept the
water from the vicinity, the water that still leaked
in around the bolt holes.</p>

<p>It was necessary to get the wad of stuff away
from the bolt holes in the flanges, for it spread out
so that it made passing of bolts from the outside
impossible. The pressure upon it from the water
under the ship at the depth of fifteen feet was
great, and I was supposed to get a line to it so that
it might be pulled away by the men on deck after
we slacked away the three-inch line by which we
had hauled it into the breach. The pipe was set
up true over the opening, the holes lined up, a few
bolts inserted point downward to steady it, and all
was ready for the man outside to get the blamed
wad away and pass the bolts upward so that their
threads would appear through the flange. I went
on deck and gazed down over the side at the warm
blue depths.</p>

<p>"Strange that the mate has to do the dog's work,"
I said to Mac, who was waiting and watching.</p>

<p>I had a line rigged under the bilge by passing it
under the bows and drifting it aft until it came
right on the line of the hole. It was slack enough
to allow a handhold, so that I could pull myself
down quickly and then let go as I pushed in a bolt.</p>

<p>I took a light line and over I went.</p>

<p>The water was fine. The light filtered down
under the ship's bilge, and it was only dark after I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
swept well under the curve of the side. Still, I
could see a little, and soon made out a mass which
I rightly took to be the mattress and stuff filling the
hole.</p>

<p>I tried to get the line fast to the thing, feeling
quickly, but I lost my breath before I got it fast
and, letting go, struggled to the surface again.</p>

<p>"What luck?" asked Mac, grinning over at me.</p>

<p>I wasted no time in idle words. I recovered and
grasped the line again and hauled myself furiously
toward the opening underneath. I could not get
the line fast, and had to come up and confess that
I had failed so far.</p>

<p>"Look out a shark don't get you," said some one
with an idea of wit.</p>

<p>"Give me a marline spike," I ordered that bos'n,
and the beggar got one, handing it to me by a line.
I dove again, and this time managed to drive the
spike in between the turns of the line holding the
mattress. The next dive I got the small line fast
to it, and, coming up, told them to slack away on
the big line inside and haul the small one outside
and get the stuffing away. It came easy enough,
and the line of interested faces peering over the
rail above bore a different look as I hung with one
hand and rested from the exertion.</p>

<p>"Now for the bolts," I said, and one was handed
down. I hauled under again and inserted it, feeling
with some satisfaction the other end being grasped
by some one inboard. Mr. Donkey Man had hold
of it all right, and, putting on a nut, set it up without
delay. This much of the job was not so hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
but I was now getting tired, and found that I could
hardly get below before I wanted to get my breath
again. I was no diver&mdash;no, not to speak of, but I
thought of that woman sitting up there waiting,
taking it easy with her insolence and white dress&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Seven other inch bolts were to be inserted before
the job could be finished inside, and the water was
pouring through the bolt holes in streams that kept
the pumps working full stroke and made working
about the opening difficult. I came on deck, and
Bill Boldwin gave me a noggin of rum, grinning
at me all the time.</p>

<p>"You ain't so bad for a mate&mdash;I've sailed with
worse," said he.</p>

<p>"The next time I sign on it'll be as a master
submarine," I said, with some feeling. "Now, if
I didn't have to wear these breeches I could do better
and faster work."</p>

<p>"Why don't you take 'em off?" he said.</p>

<p>"But the ladies&mdash;I must wear something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, what do you care for a lot of niggers?
Strip if it does you any good."</p>

<p>I was just about to take his advice when I noticed
the face of Miss Docking passing the port
along the gangway. She had been attracted by the
crowd aboard, and had come, woman-like, out of
pure curiosity, to see what was on.</p>

<p>"No," I said; "I'll fix the rest, all right&mdash;gimme
another noggin."</p>

<p>I got seven of the eight bolts in place; and the
donkey man, assisted by Mac and the entire engine-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
force, set them up one at a time after
packing the joint properly. Only one wooden plug
remained inboard, and the water squirted straight
up nearly fifteen feet with the pressure when that
was pulled out for my last attempt. If I could get
that bolt in, there was a job done that would save
the company perhaps a few hundred dollars, and
I would get&mdash;well, I might get mentioned as something
better than the ordinary mate when Bill made
his report. But that wasn't what made me do the
thing; it was the confounded spirit that Lucy
Docking stirred up within me. Oh, yes, I was a
fool, all right. I don't deny it.</p>

<p>The affair was getting to be something of a circus
by this time, and the coons who were looking
on were making remarks. I was about to clear the
gangway when I thought that here was the last
plug, the last bolt, and then for a nip and a sleep
before clearing. I went over with that last bolt,
and, as I did so, I saw Miss Lucy gazing out of a
cabin port at me. Before I went under her face
appeared above the rail and watched. I was so
tired by this time that I had the small line, which
was hambroline, fast about my armpits, so that
Mac and his crew could haul me up if I gave out
entirely. This was my mistake.</p>

<p>Down I went, and as I went under I thought
I heard the word "Shark!" muttered by some of
the colored folk above. I had just shoved in the
last bolt when a shadow passed. At the same instant
there was a mighty pull upon the line. I was
jerked bodily away, and my back scraped the huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
barnacles which covered the ship all along in the
wake of her engines clear to her sternpost. The
razor-like edges cut and stung me. I felt a mighty
desire to breathe, and tried to get upward. Then
my head struck the bottom of the ship with great
violence, and I was partly stunned. This was what
probably saved my life, for I ceased to breathe, and
the spasm passed.</p>

<p>What really happened was this:</p>

<p>A huge sawfish was swimming about the harbor,
having just come inside the reef. Tropical seas are
infested by many of these fish, which "fin out" like
a shark, and which are probably of the shark
species. The long snout, unlike the swordfish,
which is a giant mackerel, is studded with rows of
sharp teeth, put there for the Lord knows what
purpose. This monster had come close to the ship,
and the negroes had spotted him, and thought him a
shark at a distance where his snout could not be
seen.</p>

<p>Some one shouted, "Shark!" and the intelligent
bos'n hauled line with those finlike flippers of his
after the manner of a sperm-whaler coming upon
a three hundred-barrel whale. My head had struck
the ship's bilge, and my back had been cut open
with the razor-like barnacles&mdash;and then the fish,
getting frightened at the uproar, dove below, and
his teeth on his saw snout fouled the line.</p>

<p>It parted, but it parted between him and the ship,
and away I went in tow of a flying sawfish.</p>

<p>I knew nothing about it for some time, luckily;
it would have affected my nerves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Luckily the negroes were active in spite of their
laziness. A small boat, lying alongside the ship,
was instantly manned, and within a minute it was
after me, with four stout blacks pulling for all they
were worth. A man in the bow reached over and
jabbed at the line with his boat hook and jerked it
aboard. Then he lifted me in and turned me over
to the rest in the boat, while he held on to the line
and played the fish gamely for all the sport there
was in it.</p>

<p>I came to in that boat towing behind a sawfish,
which the natives seemed to think was more important
to catch than me getting back aboard and receiving
proper treatment for being nearly cut in
two and drowned.</p>

<p>The line finally broke, and they rowed me sorrowfully
back alongside. I looked up, and saw
Miss Lucy Docking gazing over the side with some
show of anxiety expressed upon her face. Also I
noted Bill Boldwin, skipper of the <i>Prince Albert</i>,
showing some interest in the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Send him aboard, you black scoundrels!"
screamed Miss Lucy. "How dare you keep that
man in the boat chasing a good-for-nothing fish?"</p>

<p>"Bring him alongside, or I'll be in there after
you," roared Bill.</p>

<p>My bos'n passed a line down, and I was quickly
hoisted aboard, where I was laid out flat on my
back, as I was still too weak to stand. Miss Lucy
herself poured whisky down my throat and
smoothed my wet hair back from my bleeding head.</p>

<p>"Arnica, you lazy rascals!" she hissed, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
one went for it. My cuts were soaked in it, and it
stung furiously, but the cuts of barnacles are poisonous,
and I rather preferred arnica to friar's balsam,
which I knew Bill would rub me with. Then
the bos'n helped me to my bunk, and Miss Lucy
Docking was left alone with me to attend to my
wants.</p>

<p>"I suppose my advice and counsel was not so
good this time?" she said as Bill left us.</p>

<p>"Well, it taught me one thing, all right
enough," I said, "and that may do me some good
in the future."</p>

<p>"And how is that?" asked the lady, looking at
me with some show of concern. She had wonderful
eyes, and her hair was noticeably curly at the
temples&mdash;and her mouth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, it will teach me never, no, never, under
any circumstances whatever, do you understand?&mdash;never
to take it again," I said, taking her hand.</p>

<p>"We'll see about that later on," she said, and her
mouth had a peculiar droop at the corners that has
been a constant source of dread to me ever since&mdash;that
is, whenever I see it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IN THE HULL OF THE "HERALDINE"</h2></div>


<p>"I understand that you did good work in
the <i>Prince Alfred</i> in time of trouble," said
Lord Hawkes, looking at me with approval.
He was manager of the Prince Line, and, when he
sent for any of us to tell us that we had done well,
it was time to&mdash;well, he didn't often do that, and I
must have shown some embarrassment.</p>

<p>I remained silent, holding my cap in my hands
and looking at Boldwin, my skipper, who had done
me the honor to report me favorably in the log
book.</p>

<p>"I hear, also," continued Lord Hawkes, "that you
are a good diver, a master workman under
water&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, your lordship," I interrupted, "I'm
but a licensed ship's officer, and what I don't know
about diving would fill a dozen empty log books."</p>

<p>"Well, at all events, you showed resource. Yes,
my good Garnett, you are a man of infinite resource.
There's no doubt about that, and that's what I'm
coming to. You are also resolute in time of trouble,
and the two qualities are what I need in the
work I am going to send you to do."</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Bill Boldwin looked scared. He didn't want to
lose his mate. He had simply spoken for me that I
might get in the good books of the company, not get
away from his ship.</p>

<p>The manager of the Bay Line seemed to be studying
some papers upon the desk before him while we
two stood respectfully in front as became seamen
in the presence of our mighty ruler. Boldwin was
keen on lords. I hadn't associated with them to any
great extent myself, but I was willing&mdash;no matter
what might be said about them.</p>

<p>"The <i>Princess Heraldine</i>, our Cape liner, left port
August the fifth," said Lord Hawkes. "She had
aboard in her safe the famous Solander diamond, a
stone nearly as large as the Cullinan and worth
something like a round half-million dollars. Also
she had about three million more in various stones
uncut and consigned to the firm here. In running
up the West African coast, she broke her crank
shaft and drove it through her bottom, tearing the
compartment to pieces, and forcing Captain Sumner
to head for Lagos in the hope of beaching her
before she sank. He managed to get her into ten
fathoms on that low, sandy coast, and she went
down about a mile or two offshore.</p>

<p>"All the passengers were saved, but by some
oversight the combination of the safe was lost at
the time they needed it, owing to the agent, Grimes,
being either too frightened or too ill to remember
it.</p>

<p>"Captain Sumner&mdash;the only other man aboard
who knew the combination&mdash;was unable to either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
leave the bridge at the critical moment of her sinking,
owing to the necessity of saving the passengers
in the small boats, or tell any one before the <i>Heraldine</i>
suddenly settled and went down, carrying five
of the crew and the entire contents of the safe along
with her."</p>

<p>Lord Hawkes looked up at me shrewdly as he
finished and gazed into my eyes.</p>

<p>I saw no necessity for a reply. There was a few
minutes' silence, then he went on:</p>

<p>"The wrecking company is now on the way there,
but there has been some trouble experienced with
them and with the underwriters. Therefore we've
deemed it worth while to send a ship&mdash;one of our
regular Cape boats on her lay-up voyage&mdash;to Lagos,
and try for the safe.</p>

<p>"The ship is a total loss, and will be covered all
right, but the diamonds are not insured, owing, as
I have said, to some disagreement with the underwriters
lately, and it has been just our luck to lose
them this voyage.</p>

<p>"You are to take the <i>Prince John</i>, and go to Lagos.
There you will find the wrecking crew waiting
orders. You are to see that we get that safe intact&mdash;you
understand? We want that safe <i>just as it
was before it went to the bottom</i>. Your orders are
here." And he handed me a folded document.
"You will leave at once."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," I said, somewhat bewildered, but
getting the lay of the thing straight enough. "Is
that all, sir?"</p>

<p>"That's all. If you wish anything regarding details,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
you will see Mr. Smith of the main office. I
wish again to impress you that this mission is important."</p>

<p>It struck me so at once. A few millions in diamonds
in ten fathoms&mdash;in a ten-ton safe! Yes, that
was something worth looking after. It was important,
all right. Seemed easy enough. Any one
who knows anything about wrecking, knows that
ten fathoms isn't too deep to work, although it's
some little ways down. It depends also upon other
conditions, which might or might not prevail. I'd
get that safe easy enough&mdash;yank it aboard all
standing, as we say at sea.</p>

<p>Well, within two days I was standing on the
bridge of the <i>Prince John</i>, and wondering how the
poor fellows in Africa managed to keep a ship of
her class afloat long enough to lay her up.</p>

<p>It was the company's policy to have their African
steamers laid up at Cape Town&mdash;helped labor, local
progress, and all that sort of thing. In reality they
got the work done for about half what it would cost
them in England.</p>

<p>The <i>Prince John</i> could make ten knots under most
favorable circumstances, but as this was her lay-up
voyage, she, as might be imagined, was not doing
her best. I think she rammed along about eight,
most of the way down; and McDougal, the chief
engineer, was working like a machinist from daylight
till dark to get her to do that.</p>

<p>We carried only the crew of six seamen and ten
firemen, with two engineers, a donkeyman, a pair of
mates, a cook, and galley boy. Just two dozen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
us all told; and, while I had never commanded a
ship of any size before, I was not suffering much
from swelled cranium as I stood upon the bridge
and gave orders.</p>

<p>Low-powered, black-sided, with the regulation
Clyde bow and round stern, she was no better than
a tramp. We carried extra diving and hoisting
gear for the wrecking crew that had preceded us.
Our winches were heavy, and built for working in
the African trade where a ship must handle her
own cargo. They would be useful in the work
ahead.</p>

<p>My mates, Simpson and Dennison, were good
men, and knew their little book all right. Simpson
had a very red nose, and looked as if he liquored on
the sly, but he never showed groggy on duty, so I
had no chance to call him down. He would continue
the voyage as captain after I got that safe
up and on its way to England. Dennison was
young and boyish. He was a good lad, and never
slept in his watch on deck&mdash;at least I never caught
him.</p>

<p>The run was uneventful, and we were sooner or
later close to the West African coast, running
through an oily sea, and pointing for Lagos.</p>

<p>One hot and stifling morning after I had worked
the sight, I was sitting in a deck chair at the pilot-house
door, thinking of Lucy Docking, and how I
might make a saving of fifteen pounds a month out
of a salary fixed at twelve. This mathematical
problem was unfinished when Dennison hailed me
from the bridge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>"Vessel right ahead, sir, anchored about a mile
and a half offshore," he said.</p>

<p>It was our friends, the wrecking crew, and we
had arrived.</p>

<p>The topmasts of the <i>Heraldine</i> stuck clear of the
oily sea. She had been a three-masted ship with
square rig forward and fore and aft upon the main
and mizzen. She had sails upon her spars already
bent after the old-time style of low-powered ships.
She lay easily in about ten or twelve fathoms, and
had a slight list to port owing to her settling a bit
upon her bilge.</p>

<p>Being very flat and wide-bottomed, she looked almost
ready to rise and continue her voyage lying as
she did in that smooth sea, and being unhurt save
for that gash in her bilge where the broken crank
tore through, thrashing her life out before the engineer
could shut off steam.</p>

<p>I pictured for a moment the huge flail, the piston
with the broken crank attached, the pieces not less
than half a ton, whirling up and down under the
full pressure of her cylinders with nothing to stop
it. There must have been a wild mess in that engine
room with a crazy hammer going full tilt like
that.</p>

<p>As in most single-screw ships, her crank must
have thrown down when connected but a foot or
two above her bilge, and when it tore loose it must
have struck full power at each and every wild throw
of the piston.</p>

<p>My business was not to raise her, however. She
was not worth it, having insurance, and being better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
as a total loss. I was after getting into the
treasure room situated just beneath the main deck
forward of the boilers.</p>

<p>The room, from the drawings furnished by her
builders, was an iron compartment ten by fifteen
feet. At one end of it&mdash;the forward one&mdash;was
built the huge safe. This was bolted down, and to
the beams.</p>

<p>It was not a new affair, having done duty for
years in the African trade, but it had a very effective
combination lock of the usual kind, and, as one
would have to open the strong-room door before
being able to get to the combination of the safe, it
was considered perfectly competent to carry any
amount of treasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Haswell, of Haswell &amp; Jones, submarine experts,
came aboard from the powerful wrecking tug,
which lay near us. He was a little man, but quite
fat. Red hair and whiskers gave his pale face a
peculiar sickly tint, but he was not a sickly man. He
was reckoned one of the best deep-water workers in
England, and could stand a very high pressure for
a long time. Little pale eyes looked shrewdly at me
as he presented his card, coming aboard as he did
from a boat rowed by six sturdy blacks&mdash;"kroo
boys," he called them. I met him at the side, and
shook hands.</p>

<p>"We're ready to begin whenever you say," he
said. "I got the firm's letter, and have only just
arrived myself. They told me you had the gear
aboard with you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have plenty of gear, all right," I answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
"and you can commence work to-day if
you want to. This place is too cold for me, and I'd
just as soon get away from here the next day, if
possible."</p>

<p>"It's some hot, all right, but one don't notice it
below so much. I suppose those derricks you've got
will hold all right&mdash;what?" And he gazed at our
hoisting gear.</p>

<p>The thermometer was one hundred and six under
the after awning, and not a breath of air stirring.
The hot, sandy coast shone like a white band, fringing
the blue water, and I wondered what kind of
weather it was on that white, sandy shore.</p>

<p>We went over the gear together, and then sat
sweating and panting for air, while the steward
brought us something cool to drink&mdash;that is, as cool
as could be procured. Then I went with Mr. Haswell
aboard the wrecking tug, and was introduced
to the working force.</p>

<p>Ten white men and twenty blacks were the outfit.
This with what I had was enough to raise the ship
had we so wished. Only two of the white men
were divers&mdash;Williams, a sturdy fellow weighing
nearly three hundred; and Mitchell, a short, powerful
man, about two hundred and fifty. Both were
under forty, and had done plenty of deep-water
work. They looked upon the job as trifling.</p>

<p>"We'll blow the deck off to-morrow, and then
tear out a side of the room," said Haswell. "After
that we can disconnect the safe, and you can get
your winches to do the rest. In three days we ought
to cover the job."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>The hot, oily calm continued. The night was
something fierce to contemplate. The sun came out
again like a molten ball of metal, and Haswell
donned his suit lazily, while the air pumps, manned
by four blacks, were started.</p>

<p>A ladder reaching a fathom down under the sea
was fastened to the tug's side, and Haswell lowered
himself over upon it, and waited for his helmet.
This was fastened by Williams, and then the air
was started.</p>

<p>As it whistled into the dome, the front glass was
screwed on, and the little man was shut off from us.
Slowly he went down and swung clear, dropping out
of sight in a storm of bubbles which rose from his
helmet.</p>

<p>I took out the water glass. This was a cylindrical
bucket with a glass bottom. By jamming one's head
into the bucket and sinking the bottom of the affair
under the sea to a depth of three or four inches,
objects could be seen about twice as distinctly as
without it&mdash;this owing to the fact that in the open
the reflection and motion of the light upon the always
moving sea surface, prevent the gaze from
following objects distinctly.</p>

<p>In order to use the water glass it was, of course,
necessary to get close to the sea.</p>

<p>I dropped into the small boat lying alongside the
wrecking tug, and leaned far over the gunwale,
peering down. The long, easy swell, the sure sign
of an immense calm area of sea, came slowly from
the westward and rolled the boat gently but enough
to keep me from getting a good look until I caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
my balance. Then I managed to get the glass down
firmly, and hold it about four inches under with my
head in the bucket.</p>

<p>At first I could make out little or nothing. The
sea was not very clear at the spot, owing to the close
proximity of the low, sandy shore where the surf
rolled incessantly, stirring up the bottom. Soon I
could make out the outline of the deck below where
the flying bridge rose within three fathoms of the
surface.</p>

<p>The <i>Heraldine</i> was drawing about twenty-two
feet when she sank, and her flying bridge was fully
twenty-five to thirty above the sea. I tried to see
farther, but could make out nothing at all.</p>

<p>The lines of the diver led toward the fore part
of the ship, and moved slightly. Williams, who
tended them, sat listlessly upon the rail of the tug,
and gave or drew in as the occasion called. I kept
looking to see things, but could make out nothing
further in the way of the wreck.</p>

<p>A huge shadow passed under me&mdash;a long, dark
shape. It was a gigantic shark nosing about the
wreck.</p>

<p>I called out to Williams.</p>

<p>"No fear," he replied lazily; "they won't hurt
him in that dress&mdash;might if he was naked."</p>

<p>The shark passed along forward, and sank down
out of sight. Then Haswell signaled that he was
coming up.</p>

<p>He came slowly, and I watched the lines coming
in. Soon the metal helmet appeared, and then he
climbed with seeming difficulty up the ladder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
helped by Williams. When he came above the rail,
he hung over it, and his front glass was unscrewed,
the pumps stopped working, and we came close to
hear the news.</p>

<p>"Located her all right," he said. "You can fix
up about twenty pounds of number two gelatine&mdash;better
put it in a tube, and be sure to make the
wires fast&mdash;have to pull it through some wreckage
down there."</p>

<p>"See anything of a big shark?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I gave him a poke in the stomach with
a stick&mdash;he won't bother me in this dress&mdash;but I did
get nipped by one of those poisonous snakes&mdash;see?"
And he held out his hand, where a small trickle of
blood ran down from the second joint of his forefinger.</p>

<p>Williams gave an exclamation. The natives
looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'll come aboard and rest a while before going
down again," said Haswell. And he was helped
aboard, and undressed.</p>

<p>His finger swelled while this was being done, and,
by the time he stood in his flannels, he had a hand
that was fast turning black. Williams said little.
The poisonous water snakes that infest certain tropical
seas close to the river mouths were known to
him. Those in the Indian Ocean are especially dangerous.</p>

<p>Haswell gazed at the blackening finger, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Better give me some whisky," he said. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
drank, and sat down. Williams stood near, and
Mitchell came up.</p>

<p>"That's a bad bite," said Mitchell.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose there's no use waiting any
longer&mdash;cut it off, and be quick," said Haswell.</p>

<p>Mitchell, iron-nerved and steady, cut the finger
off close to the hand, and stopped the flow of blood
with a strong bandage. The swelling continued,
and the arm began to pain greatly.</p>

<p>"Cut away the hand," said Haswell, white and
shaky, but showing an amazing coolness. He realized
his danger. Mitchell performed another amputation.</p>

<p>Within an hour they had his arm off at the elbow,
and Haswell was turning blue all over.</p>

<p>It was an uncanny thing&mdash;right there in that
bright sunshine, a man done a mortal injury by
some foul sea vermin that had attacked him in the
depths. I had heard of the sea snakes that come
down the African rivers and go well offshore, but
had never seen one. Those in the Indian Ocean I
had seen often, and remembered that they were
about four or five feet long and a few inches in circumference.</p>

<p>Haswell, with remarkable nerve, faced his end
unflinchingly. It was wonderful to see him sitting
there, unafraid, with his arm three times its natural
size at the shoulder where the last bandage of Mitchell
had been fastened.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll last about an hour longer," he finally
said. "It's&mdash;no&mdash;use." His strength was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
leaving him, and he spoke haltingly, in hardly more
than a whisper.</p>

<p>They gave him more whisky, and waited. Then
Williams took down his last words in reference to
his family affairs, and Haswell laid himself down
on a transom. Two hours later he was stone dead.</p>

<p>That was a beginning that would have shaken the
nerve of many men. Mitchell had his partner sewn
up in canvas, and they buried him far out at sea,
rowing off in the small boat.</p>

<p>The next day Williams started down. He found
the location of the strong room, and was careful to
wear heavy gloves while working. Then he placed
the charge.</p>

<p>The crack that followed was not loud&mdash;deep
down as it was. A storm of bubbles arose to the
surface, and the sea lifted a few inches just over
the place where the gelatine exploded. Then Mitchell
prepared to go down and examine the result.</p>

<p>The oily sea heaved and sank with the long swell,
and there was nothing to indicate that there would
be any trouble. Nothing could move the wreck.
Mitchell went under at eleven that morning, and,
after he had been down half an hour, Williams signaled
him. He received no answer. With some
anxiety, the big man started to haul line, when, to
the horror of all, the two lines&mdash;hose and life line&mdash;came
in easily without anything at their end.</p>

<p>The hose showed a clean cut well down near the
helmet, and the life line showed a ragged cut or
break which stranded it out a full foot. Mitchell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
was left below, cut off from us as clean as if he had
been left upon the moon.</p>

<p>Williams strove with all haste to get into another
suit, but it was a good ten minutes before he did so.
He went down with a man of his outfit holding line
for him, and came back in ten minutes with a white
face and staring eyes.</p>

<p>"Whole side of the room fell on him," he said;
"cut his hose and&mdash;and left him there. Give me a
line, I'll get him out."</p>

<p>"Dead?" I whispered.</p>

<p>He looked up at me from the circular hole in the
helmet, and seemed to think me mad.</p>

<p>"Dead? Of course, he's dead&mdash;a ton or two of
iron on top of him, and no air&mdash;sure he's dead.
We'll have to put the line to the winch to haul him
out from under it."</p>

<p>We buried Mitchell as we had Haswell, hauling
him from under the wreckage by a line to our steam
winch, and afterward carrying him well out to sea,
where he was weighted and sunk. It was bitter
work, and all the time that hot sun shone down upon
us until the seams of the decks warped and the tar
ran out of the lanyards.</p>

<p>Williams was shaken. The next day he refused
to go down, and pleaded a rest necessary. His men
were silent and awed. I could say nothing to urge
them on, as I felt that they had endured enough for
a few days, at least.</p>

<p>Then Williams was taken with the African fever,
and there was no one left who would go below for
any amount of money offered. The horror of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
thing had shaken the nerves of the entire outfit.
There might be millions below there, but no man
of that crew would touch them just at present, and
we were lying there in that oily sea, eating up the
company's money and cursing at the strange chance
that had made our expedition so fatal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the end of a week Williams was so bad that
I gave him up as a factor to help us. At times he
was delirious, and raved horribly. His men were
for abandoning the work, and putting into Lagos,
and from there clearing for home.</p>

<p>I refused to hear of such a thing, although I was
a bit worked up at the outcome of what had at first
appeared to be an easy job. To send North for
more divers was to delay the work months. To
await the coming of the next coast steamer meant
delay of at least three weeks&mdash;and even then there
was no certainty of help from her. She didn't
carry divers, and, although she would naturally give
me any aid in her power, belonging to our company
as she did, I felt that I would rather not ask anything
from her skipper until the last act.</p>

<p>A man named Rokeby of the tug's working crew
offered to tend line for me if I chose to go down.
He assured me that the pressure at fifty or even
sixty feet would not injure me. I might suffer
some from the splitting headache natural to the
pressure, but that was all. I could blow open the
safe or get chains fast to it, or cut it adrift somehow.</p>

<p>I thought over the matter while Williams raved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and rolled in his sweltering bunk, and the sun shone
down upon that dead ocean full of crawling life and
hidden treasure.</p>

<p>"Gimme the gloves and plenty of air," I finally
said, after waiting three days, hoping that some of
the wrecking crew would get their nerve back.</p>

<p>They all showed willingness to work if I went
down, and I was soon incased in the suit of Williams.</p>

<p>If you think I was not nervous, you should have
had an inside photo of my mind as I stood there
upon the rounds of the ladder waiting for Rokeby
to screw fast the front glass. I would have given
it up but for the looks of the men. They seemed
to gaze upon me with a sort of awe and amazement,
but they made no comment whatever.</p>

<p>The kroo boys swung the pump handles with a
will, and when I heard the hiss of the air I must
say my heart gave two jumps and came near landing
overboard&mdash;at least, it felt that way; but I
would have died rather than let those men see that
I was afraid. Such is the ego, the vanity of us all.</p>

<p>"Shall I screw her on, sir?"</p>

<p>The voice was Rokeby's, and it aroused me from
the contemplation of the thing to do. I tried to
look bored and annoyed.</p>

<p>"Yes, screw it down&mdash;mind the lines tenderly,
and pull me right up if I give the signal," I said.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," he answered, and he screwed in
the front glass.</p>

<p>The air whistled into the helmet back of my head,
and the noise aroused me to a sense of the danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
should it suddenly cease. I put one foot and then
another upon the ladder rungs, and went down until
I swung off.</p>

<p>It seemed as if I was about to fly off into space,
and for a few moments I almost lost my balance.
Then my heavy leaden shoes sank me straight down,
and I dropped slowly until my feet touched something.</p>

<p>The light had gradually faded as I left the surface,
and where I now stood it seemed to be pitch
dark. The pressure of the air appeared to swell my
head, and a roaring was in my ears. Then I determined
to do something, and bent forward to see if I
could.</p>

<p>Gradually the dim outline of the ship's deck took
form before the glass&mdash;that is, the deck in my immediate
vicinity. I could make out the rail, and began
pulling myself along by it. Soon I came to the
pilot house forward, and recognized it by feeling
the panels of the glass front with my hands.</p>

<p>I knew that I was just about right in regard to
position, and started for the rail to get over the
side and down to the place where the blow-out had
been made. I carefully swung one leg over and
then another, amazed at the ease with which I lifted
the immense leaden shoes. Then guiding my air
hose and line clear of the rail, I slipped off, and
dropped down to the bottom far below.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that I had now been under
several minutes, I could not make out objects well
enough to do anything; but determined to try to
feel for the opening to the safe. After ten minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
spent groping about, I felt an immense hole in
the ship's side, my fingers going carefully around
the edges where the torn plates told of the force of
the blast.</p>

<p>I entered and felt for the sides of the room
within where the blast had torn out the iron and
held it hanging to drop upon the unfortunate Mitchell.
I now saw I could do nothing without more
light, and carefully made my way out to the sea
floor, where I signaled to haul me up.</p>

<p>I came slowly, and as I did so my brain appeared
swelling until it seemed no longer possible to hold
it within my skull. The pain was intense, and I
hardly noticed the growing light until I was at the
foot of the ladder. Then I climbed up, being
dragged bodily by my life line. The front was
taken off my helmet, and I spoke.</p>

<p>"It's all right," I panted, "get the lamp out, and
stand by to send me down the tools I'll need."</p>

<p>Rokeby gave me a small drink of whisky, and the
rest soon had the electric lamp ready. I went below
again. This time I had no trouble in finding my
way, for the light from the spark penetrated the sea
for several feet about me.</p>

<p>In the watery darkness I made out the hole, and
saw the damage done by the charge. The entire
wall of the compartment had been blown in, and,
in going into the room, Mitchell had gotten under
it so that he had dislodged an immense piece of
plate which had fallen upon him, and cut off his air
and line.</p>

<p>I went forward cautiously, and poked the lamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
ahead of me. It seemed a long way to the safe,
but I finally came up against it, and made out its
outline in the lamplight. Its edge stood out sharply.
Beyond was the inky blackness of a tomb.</p>

<p>I saw that it would be necessary for me to blow it
loose from the beams, as I was not good enough
workman to cut or loosen the bolts. Making a
hasty but pretty good examination of the bottom
and sides, I determined to go back aboard and study
it out. A little powder underneath would loosen the
floor bolts, and then, with a stout chain about it,
we might start the winches to haul it through the
opening, which I saw would have to be enlarged
at the bottom. I came up, and was satisfied for the
day.</p>

<p>The next morning I had recovered my nerve to a
great extent, and was eager to get to work. The
men were also better pleased at the prospect. My
head had bothered me all night, but now eased up,
as I donned the rubber.</p>

<p>So far I had seen neither fish nor crawling reptile.
The bottom was not very soft, however, and
was so covered with weed and sea growths that it
may have harbored many things not visible to the
eye at that depth. I kept to the gloves, not daring
to risk my hands after Haswell's fatal ending.</p>

<p>The first shot tore the bottom off the compartment,
and left the safe hanging by the bolts against
the bulkhead. The second shot broke away these,
and, when I went down again, I found the safe
had dropped down to the deck below, the powder,
or rather nitrogelatine, having torn the deck away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
for the space of fifteen feet or more, leaving ragged
splinters of deck planking sticking forth.</p>

<p>The electric lamp showed the mass below me as
I stood at the edge of the hole, and I very carefully
drew my line and air so that they would not
foul when I dropped over. Then I went down and
found the safe intact, but in a very difficult position
to handle.</p>

<p>The next blast required a large charge, in order
to blow the side out down to the lower deck, as it
was impossible to drag that safe up through the
hole. I placed fifty pounds of gelatine in two
charges just abreast the safe on the outside of the
hull, and blew away the plates until a trolley car
could almost have entered the hole in the ship's
side.</p>

<p>I was all ready now for getting slings upon the
treasure, and I could hardly wait until the next
day.</p>

<p>The wreck was in very bad shape below from the
effects of the blasts, but I was nearly done now.
Another day might find the diamonds upon the deck
of the old ship above me. I managed to pass turns
of a heavy chain around the safe, and stop them
up so that they could be hocked to the fall. Then
I got the tackle down, and by means of a whip to the
tug started the mass of metal outboard.</p>

<p>It came along all right, and I thought it would
go clear. Then something suddenly stopped it below,
and I had to go down again to clear it. It
was fast in the hole, having jammed against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
edge so that no amount of pulling would break it
clear.</p>

<p>I lost no time getting another tackle to it, and
rigged it to lift it end up, and turn it over, then the
first fall would pull it out and clear. I was getting
pretty well used to being below by this time, and
the headache was lessening. I found that I could
remain under fully half an hour now, and work
most of that time.</p>

<p>The last time I went below I had a premonition
that all was not as it should be down there, and I
went along very carefully. I made my way into
the ship's hull, and was just getting the new tackle
set up taut and ready, when the whole ship heeled
suddenly to port. The safe slewed sideways and
slid down the now slanting deck, blocking the hole
entirely across, but leaving my lines and tackle clear.</p>

<p>I signaled to come up at once. Then my line
jerked, hauled me close up to the opening, and there
I jammed, stuck so I could not get back. I signaled
frantically for help, and they pulled me with all
their might. But they might as well have tried to
lift the wreck itself. I was caught.</p>

<p>During the next few minutes I thought a great
deal. The horror of my situation dawned upon
me. I was fast below there&mdash;not a chance for getting
out. There seemed nothing to do, but wait
placidly for the end.</p>

<p>The next few minutes were hours to me. I could
signal with the line, but that was all. They knew
I was alive, and they knew something must have
happened by the heeling of the sunken wreck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>The blasting had probably blown away the sandy
bottom under her, and she had simply cast over and
slid the stuff to leeward.</p>

<p>There was plenty of room to take that safe out
endways, but it was now so fixed that some one
would have to slew it around before that could be
done. My lamp was still burning, and the blackness
lost some of its terrors in that pitiful light.</p>

<p>I was in the hull of a lost ship, and I felt that
I was indeed a lost man. Memories came and went
with lightning-like rapidity. I thought of Lucy
Docking, and wondered how she would take my
death. Then I began to feel the effects of the pressure,
and my head grew flighty.</p>

<p>I dreamed of beautiful blue skies and green fields,
the shore, the mountains; and all the time Lucy was
with me, going from place to place. I was not unhappy.
There was a feeling of contentment with
the woman I had chosen, and it was all real, so
real that I only awoke under the vicious pulling
upon my life line by the men above.</p>

<p>Then the horror of my situation came back to
me, and the roaring in my ears told me of my predicament.
I gazed out of the front glass into the
dark medium about me, the rays of the lamp making
sharp outlines and shadows.</p>

<p>I remembered the safe. It lay jammed across
the hole, and, while I was too feeble to take great
interest, I recall watching it with a sort of fascination.
I felt its sides, its edges. Then the combination
attracted me, shining as it did in the dim
light, like a bit of white in the surrounding blackness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
I lazily turned the knob, whirled it about.
And all the time they were pumping air to me
under the pressure of fifty feet of water.</p>

<p>I felt at the aperture above where the edge of
the safe shut off the opening. There was nearly a
foot of clear room, but this was not enough for my
figure, incased as it was in the suit. It was ample
for the life line and hose to pass through without
any interruption at all, and all I had to do was to
live long enough for them to get that safe away.
Surely some one would come down, and try to
sling it again properly.</p>

<p>I lay with my front glass to the opening, and held
the lamp so that the rays would shine outside.
There I watched and tried to control the thoughts
that kept coming with a surging feeling of dread
that made my heart thump all the harder. Drowsiness
would come, and the whirling in my brain
would get me back again to the land and beautiful
dreams. Then the jerking and hauling, and trying
to dislodge me would arouse me again, and I would
come back to the present.</p>

<p>I remember watching through the opening, and
seeing forms passing. These must have been fish,
or denizens of the sea. They flitted through the
range of the lamp like sudden ghosts, the light
striking their bodies, and then disappearing into
the blackness without.</p>

<p>The lamp suddenly went out.</p>

<p>I was seized with the wildest terror at the inky
blackness about me. The full horror of it all now
came with greater force. That tiny spark had kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
me up wonderfully. It had seemed like a ray of
hope. I put out my hands with muscles shaking and
trembling, feeling that inexorable edge of iron that
shut me off from life.</p>

<p>Would Rokeby try it? Would he try to save me?</p>

<p>That was the final thought. I tried to put myself
in his place. I would do much for a man dying
by inches&mdash;dying where he might be saved if one
would take a little risk. He might get below in
time yet. He might get a whip upon that safe, and,
with the powerful wrecking tug working her
winches, upset the huge square of steel, and drag it
out of the way.</p>

<p>But if he was coming down, he should have come
hours ago. As a matter of fact, I had already
been down half an hour, and I could stand it for at
least twice that long yet. But it seemed to me that
I had been abandoned, that they were too cowardly
to try to save me. My whirling brain and roaring
ears told me a story of days of suffering, of interminable
torture.</p>

<p>Would Rokeby try it?</p>

<p>I remembered how it struck me when Mitchell's
line came up cut off from him. I knew what that
poor fellow had gone through; what he had suffered,
at least, for a few moments down there.</p>

<p>No, I would hardly blame Rokeby for not trying
it. It was too dangerous for any one to try.
And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That latent hope, that feeling that there would
be something at last, kept me from dying. The air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
was still coming down, and I was in no immediate
danger.</p>

<p>I tried to make myself think that I was in no
danger at all; that all would be well when Rokeby
came down, and got a hold of the safe. But I
knew in my heart that the men above, the whole
general crew, were not the men to help.</p>

<p>As a record of fact, the men above were awed at
the disaster, and only Rokeby's steadiness saved my
life. He had the pumps kept going, and finally decided
that he would have to take a chance down
there, or let me die like a hooked fish. He was man
enough to overcome the nerve-shaking dangers that
had beset us, and he put on another suit. Then,
with his breath fairly gone from fright, he went
down to help me.</p>

<p>He had never gone below before, except under
most favorable conditions and in very shallow
water. Still, he knew what to do, and he managed
to get a good man above to tend line for him. He
found things in bad shape at the opening, but lost
no more time than he could help getting a purchase
to the end of that safe, and the winches started. In
half an hour they had dragged it clear of the ship,
and I was hauled aboard insensible, but still alive.</p>

<p>Before I had regained my senses, they had the
safe fast aboard the old hooker, and I had the
satisfaction of staggering on deck to view it.</p>

<p>There it was, all right, perfectly intact. I had
saved the company several millions, and it had cost
the lives of two men, and nearly my own.</p>

<p>There was not a moment lost in getting away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
from that hot, unhealthy coast. We got under way
that very evening with Williams still stricken with
the fever, and myself too weak to sit up, but I would
not stop a minute.</p>

<p>"Get her under way at once," I said, and the
mates needed no urging.</p>

<p>The wrecking tug, under full steam, came alongside,
and the safe was slung carefully over to her
deck, where it was bolted down and made as fast as
a sailor could make it. I put a metal line about it,
and sealed it up, not even willing to trust to the
safe combination that had withstood the blasts and
the sea.</p>

<p>"Good-by, and a pleasant voyage to the Cape for
you," I said to my former shipmates. They steamed
away to the southward to lay the old ship up for repairs,
and we, in the mighty wrecker, <i>Viking</i>, under
full power and making fifteen knots the hour, stood
back for old England, where we arrived safe
enough a short time later.</p>

<p>"Captain Gantline?" The words escaped
me like a shot from a gun.</p>

<p>"Sure as eggs&mdash;'n where did you come
from?" said that stout seaman. He stood at the
bar of Bill's place on Telegraph Hill, drinking rum.
His eyes, crinkled up at the corners like the ripples
of a ship's cutwater in a smooth sea, were bloodshot
and liquor-soaked. Old man Gantline was
broad of beam and shorter than myself&mdash;no real
good seaman is tall&mdash;and he raised his empty
glass and hammered upon the bar with it.</p>

<p>"Gimme another drink," said he to the barkeeper.
Then he turned to me. "So it's you fer sure, old
man&mdash;well, well, what a small world it is, after all!
Take a nip&mdash;I'm sure glad to see you&mdash;an' how'd
it happen?"</p>

<p>I saw that old Gantline was getting drunk. It
was a shame. The old skipper was a crack packet
skipper. I was amazed at him, for he was not a
drinking man. I wondered what made him do it.
The barkeeper was now opening another bottle, and
I knew the old sailor had drunk much.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>"I blew in from New York around the Cape last
week," I said.</p>

<p>"Must 'a' been blowin' some, hey, then&mdash;kinder
quick passage&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean I made the run in a week&mdash;we
were one hundred and sixty days&mdash;but I've been
here in Frisco a week. And I've spent all the money
I saved from the munificent owners of the British
ship <i>Glenmar</i>, who rated me as second mate at
thirty per&mdash;or, rather, five pun ten a month. I
tried to eat something since I came in to make up
for what I didn't get at sea. Those Englishmen are
sure on short commons, all right&mdash;but I haven't
been drinking. I don't drink."</p>

<p>"I do," said Gantline.</p>

<p>"I see it," I answered; "but it don't seem to do
you any good, though it isn't for me to tell you so,
I know. A drink or two don't hurt any one much,
but pour it in, and come with me, and listen to my
tale of woe. I need some one who knows something
to listen to me&mdash;I'm broke."</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno as I might jest as well," sighed
Gantline. "I'll take a couple more noggins&mdash;then
you can come down to the ship with me."</p>

<p>"Sure, that's just what we'll do&mdash;go down aboard&mdash;hurry
up and poison yourself sufficiently," I said,
and waited until he had soaked down a few more
drafts of liquid fire. Then, as he was growing unsteady,
I linked his arm in my own, and we went
slowly down Market Street until we came to the
water front.</p>

<p>"That's her layin' out there&mdash;<i>Silas Tanner</i>&mdash;four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>

<p>"What? A schooner? You in a schooner&mdash;how'd
you come to go in a fore-and-after, Gantline?
You, an old square-rigger!"</p>

<p>"That's hit, thash hit, Clew&mdash;me, an old seaman,
in a coaster&mdash;for'n aft&mdash;Chinks for passengers&mdash;cabin,
too&mdash;ladies aft&mdash;I'm clear drunk, Clew&mdash;an'
I don't care 'f 'am&mdash;nuff to make a man drunk,"
mumbled Gantline.</p>

<p>It was high time to get him to his ship. I hailed
a small boat, and got him aboard, and then we went
out to the <i>Tanner</i>&mdash;four-masted schooner, now riding
at anchor off Market Street, San Francisco,
waiting for a tide and something I could not guess
as yet.</p>

<p>She was heavily loaded, all right, and I wondered
at the old man's conduct the more. The idea
of him forgetting himself at the last minute! It
was too much. And with a mate like Slade&mdash;Slade,
who had sailed in several ships with me, the best
mate I had known for many a year. We drew
alongside.</p>

<p>"Lower down the side ladder&mdash;the skipper's coming
up," I sang out, and a head came to the high
rail. It was the mate's.</p>

<p>"Christopher Columbus! How'd this happen?"
asked Slade. "And how&mdash;how'd you turn up? I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
glad to see you, old man&mdash;pass him up&mdash;look out
he don't fall overboard."</p>

<p>We managed to get the skipper on deck, and then
below to his bunk, Slade questioning me all the time,
and asking about times gone by. Then, after we
had the old man safely stowed, we came on deck
together, and Slade told me the trouble.</p>

<p>"Bound out for Guam with cargo and fifty
coolies&mdash;Chinks&mdash;for labor there. We got a passenger's
license, and take out several first class to
Manila, besides. Loaded down with general cargo,
and two safes full of silver for circulation at Aga&ntilde;a&mdash;about
ten thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the trouble?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The old man don't like the coolie idea," Slade
went on. "He hates Chinks. We got all loaded
up, and then the owners sent word that we must
provide quarters for fifty men&mdash;Chinamen, too, at
that&mdash;and the old man threw a fit. He'd have quit
the ship, but he's bought into her, and can't do it.
We had to clear out the alleyways under the poop,
knock ports in the sides, and build up a line of
shelves for 'em to sleep on&mdash;twenty-five on a side,
and right next the after saloon&mdash;-couldn't get them
below&mdash;see the doors we cut in the bulkhead? Lets
'em out on deck. It's a government contract, and
it's good pay, all right&mdash;but them dirty coolies! It's
a shame to make an old fellow like Gantline carry
them&mdash;he hates' em so."</p>

<p>"Who's second under you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody&mdash;thought you'd come for it. Isn't that
what you're here for?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>"Not that I know of," I answered. "But I'll take
it if the old man says so, all right, all right. I've
been ashore long enough&mdash;broke, too."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said Slade. "You're as good as
signed on right now&mdash;soon as he gets over it he'll
ask you to go&mdash;never saw the old man like that before,
and it's a pity, too. 'Never thought I'd run
a slaver,' says he&mdash;and I don't much blame him,
either."</p>

<p>"I'll send down my dunnage in the morning," I
said. "How about the crew?"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll get them, all right. Whisky Bill's
attended to it&mdash;we'll get ten men&mdash;all we need with
the engine for handling line."</p>

<p>I hastened ashore to settle my affairs and get my
dunnage down to the ship.</p>

<p>In payment for my last week's board I gave my
landlord a whale's tooth, carved prettily&mdash;or, rather,
I left it behind for him to accept gracefully, and
before daylight in the morning I was aboard the
<i>Tanner</i>. Gantline was so glad to see me come that
he almost forgot his headache. I signed for the
voyage and went on duty.</p>

<p>The decks of the schooner were somewhat disordered
that morning she was to leave. Honolulu
was her first stop, and there was much to go on
deck for that shorter run. The crimp had just
brought down the men, and we mates upset each
seaman's bag of dunnage, and scattered the contents
about the gangway. We searched for hidden
liquor and firearms, well knowing a sailor's habits,
and we knocked things about a little hunting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
them. The poor, half-sober devils could separate
their belongings afterward as best they might.</p>

<p>The result of the search was that, after the mate
had confiscated a few bottles of stuff and a couple
of out-of-date revolvers and ammunition, the general
pile divided up among the men was enough to
refill each bag again, the effort of sorting personal
belongings at that moment being entirely too laborious
to entertain.</p>

<p>Slade took two bottles, and managed to secrete
them upon his person while the eye of the skipper
was diverted to a passenger who had just appeared.
Slade was slanting toward the forward cabin with
the goods, closely followed by his emulating second
officer, when the voice of the old man roared out
orders for me to see to getting the baggage of the
passengers below without delay. I turned, somewhat
disappointed, just as Slade entered the door
of the saloon and winked slowly and meaningly
at me.</p>

<p>With some small encomiums pronounced upon
the untimely work cut out for me, I turned to the
gangway, and ordered up a few men in tones and
language I should hate to repeat.</p>

<p>As I did so I suddenly came face to face with the
passenger who had come from behind a cab and
started down the gangway plank to the ship's deck.
She put her lorgnette up to her eyes and gazed
smilingly at me. Then she was joined by a younger
woman, a girl about twenty, who took the older
woman's arm, led her down the plank to the deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and went right into the door of the forward cabin,
leaving me staring as though I had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>"I don't got no good eyes, den, if dat ain't de
purtiest gal I ever see," said a Dutchman who was
waiting to hear further orders from me. Another
man, with a loose lip, looked up and scratched his
head.</p>

<p>"Get, you squareheads&mdash;get a move on before
something happens to you," I growled.</p>

<p>"I do love to hear them swear so," said the elder
lady, as she reached the door. "They're such romantic
fellows&mdash;so bold&mdash;oh, dear, just hear what
that man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come along, auntie, come back where the captain
is. I never heard such language before, and
I don't think it a bit romantic&mdash;no, not at all. It's
all dreadfully vulgar, and all that&mdash;but that man&mdash;well,
well, he does say some amusing things, even
if they are not what they should be."</p>

<p>Miss Aline MacDonald led her aunt aft, and I
breathed easier. That she had flung me a sort of
compliment was certain. I knew it. I had more
queer ways of cussing out a Dutchman than any
Yankee mate afloat&mdash;I knew that&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Gantline met them as they entered, and extended
his hand.</p>

<p>"Come aft, ladies, come aft, and I'll have the
stewardess show you your rooms at once&mdash;hope
they'll suit you&mdash;best in the ship. Of course, we
don't compete with the steamers, but a voyage in
this schooner will be worth two in a steamer as a
health restorer. If things ain't the way you like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
them, sing out&mdash;I'll do the best I can." And he led
the way aft to where a Kanaka woman took them
in charge. Then I ducked into the mate's room, and
joined Slade for a few minutes. He had already
pulled a cork.</p>

<p>"Ain't adverse none to passengers," said he, pouring
out the liquor, "but you may sink me if that
old un don't come near the limit&mdash;you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Give me a drink and shut up about passengers,"
I grinned. "The old one's all right. She appreciated
my education&mdash;sort of goo-gooed at me while
I was laying out some language&mdash;quick with the
booze, before the old man gets wise to it."</p>

<p>We hurried back on deck in time to take charge
of things, and we were soon ready and waiting for
the coolies, who were to come aboard from the tug
that would tow us out to sea.</p>

<p>The tug <i>Raven</i> took our towline and we warped
out, swung around, and were headed for the open
sea within a few minutes. The engineer had steam
up in the donkey, and the winches turned. Our crew
were used to fore-and-aft canvas, and Slade took
the turns as the halyards came to the revolving
drums, being helped, as I may say, by his second
mate, who held the peak as he held the throat.</p>

<p>We snatched stoppers upon them as the sails came
to the mastheads, and in less time than it takes to
tell we had all save the headsails on the <i>Tanner</i>, and
were standing out. The tug dropped back, and
came alongside, taking her lines.</p>

<p>"Stand by fer yore passengers," bawled a red-headed
fellow, grinning from the pilot house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>I now saw a crowd of yellow-tails gathering on
the tug's deck. Fifty-seven of them, all told, led by
a giant yellow man in a skullcap and long, braided
cue. A chattering babble of Chink talk, and the
big fellow hustled the crowd to the rail, up the
schooner's side, and on deck in less than a minute.</p>

<p>Bundles, packages, clothes, came with them, and
Slade gave up the premeditated job of searching
them in a few moments as he saw the yellow men
gather up their belongings and crowd about the
break of the poop, jamming in a mass right under
the edge from where Gantline leaned over and
gazed down at them in sour amazement and distrust.</p>

<p>"Me makee dem tlake-a down, down," cooed the
giant leader in a sing-song voice, pointing with his
hand at the crowd of Chinamen.</p>

<p>"Yes, git below&mdash;git out an' be quick about it,"
snarled the old man from above him. "You're
blockin' the decks&mdash;slam 'em in the alleyways, git
'em out the way," he continued to Slade and myself.</p>

<p>"No lika men high, a-a-h, aye, makee down,
down," sang the giant, with a glint in his little slits
of eyes.</p>

<p>He was an ugly animal. Talk about your Oriental
being a degenerate! Well, that fellow was
nothing degenerate physically. He was six feet
four, and about half as wide across the hulking
shoulders. A thin-lipped mouth ran clear across his
face; his nose was flat, like an African's. A whitish-blue
scar had ripped his pleasing features from eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to chin on the starboard side, and his head was
enormous.</p>

<p>The hair was shaved close up to the limits of that
skullcap of black silk, and from under its lower end
there dropped a cue about a fathom long, all done
up with silk cords and stuff, until a pretty little
black tassel was plaited into the end, surmounted
by a Matthew Walker knot and a couple of Turks'
heads.</p>

<p>He was something to notice, all right, and his
voice was grand. Nothing of the nervous squeak
of the coolie about it. It sang along with flutelike
notes that bristled full of "I's" and "Ah's," until
you thought he was singing it to his men in a sort
of deep bass or baritone.</p>

<p>Understand him? Did you ever know any white
man who could understand a Chink if that fellow
didn't talk for him to understand it? No, we took
it for granted that the "boss" coolie was on the
level, and was arguing with the herd to corral them
into the alleyways where they belonged. He understood
the skipper right enough.</p>

<p>A stout yellow man edged from the press about
the door of the forward house, and came to the big
man's side. A soft gabble, then a yell, then the
herd took the alleyways on the jump, and inside of
ten seconds there was not a yellowskin on deck.</p>

<p>"Got 'em trained, all right enough," said Slade,
with a grin. "The old man needn't worry about
'em if the big one goes at it that way."</p>

<p>"Fifty-seven Chinks on a dead man's chest&mdash;and
I'll bet my month's pay they've a bottle of rum&mdash;maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
a hundred," I ventured. "What's the big
cheese's name?"</p>

<p>"Sink me, if I know! The old man called him
'Yaller Dog,' and he's that, all solid. Let it go at
that. I'd sure like to have him in my watch. What
a man he'd make on a earing in a blow!"</p>

<p>"Shall we deal them their rice raw or cooked?" I
asked. "I suppose they won't eat it if it's cooked
in the galley, and then they'd be trying to build fires
under the cabin or in the lazaret to boil it."</p>

<p>"No; let 'em eat it or throw it overboard. What
do you care? Turn the men to, and choose the
watch, and then I'll go below for a rest."</p>

<p>I did so, and soon the Farallones were disappearing
in the east astern.</p>

<p>The first two days out there was so much to do
aboard that I hardly had time to observe things.
The decks were lumbered up with all kinds of gear,
and a load of stuff for Honolulu, which took all our
time to secure. The men were under the union
scale of the West Coast&mdash;that is, thirty dollars per
month&mdash;and there was nothing off on account of
our going deep-water in her, for we were not by
any means coasting at all, as our course lay directly
across the Pacific Ocean, and the itinerary took in
a voyage of seven thousand miles.</p>

<p>I hated the fore-and-aft canvas. I knew its value
on short runs and in smooth seas, but when it comes
to deep water and a rough old ocean, with a twenty-five-knot
wind increasing to fifty, give me the square
canvas with double topsails, that men can handle.</p>

<p>However, we were very fast. The <i>Tanner</i> could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
do fifteen knots free on a wind that would jam a
square-rigger close and by. Her four masts were
of the usual type, all the same, and her gaff-topsails
were high on the hoist, giving her a tall appearance.</p>

<p>The first day under all sail, with the wind abeam,
she rolled off thirteen and fourteen knots an hour,
and kept her decks awash under a perfect torrent of
foam, dragging her rail through a solid mass of
suds. She simply ran, shoved her sharp nose out
through it, and slipped over the long, smooth, rolling
swell with a plunging lift that felt good.</p>

<p>The steam winches for handling line were good.
With drums turning, all one had to do was to snatch
the halyard in the deck block, grab a turn on the
drum, and up went anything that could go. Then
a stopper on the line, and to the belaying pin&mdash;and
all was done. There was no hee-hawing, no singing
of sailor's chanteys, no sailoring of the type we had
known in our earlier days; but I am free to admit
that I would rather have had the steam winches&mdash;especially
when it came on to blow and we had to
reef her down.</p>

<p>The Chinks were allowed on deck from eight bells
in the morning until eight at night; and they were
always getting in the way.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald and her aunt came on deck most
of the time, and sat wrapped in rugs near the wheel,
where the old man entertained them with tales of
the sea. They were greatly interested in the Chinamen.</p>

<p>I found my watch on the poop not at all disagreeable
during daylight, for Miss Aline was good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to look at. She was of medium height, with brown
hair that curled in spite of the sea wind, and she
was solidly and strongly built, her figure having
lines that told of sturdiness rather than delicate
beauty. But although she was not what one would
call fat, or even stout, she was certainly not thin,
and her rounded face was rosy with health.</p>

<p>Her mouth had a peculiar gentleness of expression,
and when she showed her white teeth to me
and flushed a bit upon recognizing the master
handler of fluent oaths, I thought her about as good
as they come. I was a bit embarrassed, but I was
only second greaser, and as such could not sit at
the table with her, so I said little.</p>

<p>I told Slade, however, that his hands were unfit
to pass salt junk to a lady&mdash;and, for a wonder, he
washed them in fresh water before going below!
He was mate, and could sit in with the skipper,
while I walked the deck above and made mental
comments upon the irony of fate that shoved in a
fellow like him to entertain a girl that he could
not speak to without stammering like a drunken
man, while I&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p>It was in my watch during dinner that I had the
first real chance to see our coolie boss. The second
week, after things had settled themselves, and the
routine of the ship took the place of the frantic
scramble to get things shipshape, I stood at the
break of the poop, which in the <i>Tanner</i> was very
low&mdash;not more than four feet above the deck, as is
the case in many schooners&mdash;and as I stood there
up popped Yellow Dog, the giant Chink, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
door of the alleyway to starboard. The beggar was
so tall that he was almost on a level with myself, in
spite of the difference in the decks, and I found his
eyes close to mine as he turned and saw me.</p>

<p>"Have any trouble in the passageway?" I asked
him, thinking he might have been a bit mixed in
straightening out that gang below in the narrow
space.</p>

<p>He gave me a look, a slanting glance from the
corners of his little, screwed-up eyes, and then he
turned his back upon me as if I had been bilge
water, and offended his senses.</p>

<p>"Hey, Yellow Dog! What's the matter with
you? Are you tongue-tied? Don't you know
enough of ship's etiquette to answer an officer when
he speaks?" I spat at him.</p>

<p>"I tlakee captain man&mdash;not you," he sang, in his
musical voice, and he forthwith strode to the galley,
where a Kanaka cook was busy with the dinner.</p>

<p>"You great big Yellow&mdash;&mdash;" But there is no
use of telling what I remarked to him as he went
along that deck. As the officer in command at the
moment, I was not a little offended by this high-handed
way of a common Chink, more especially as
I was inquiring for the welfare of his men.</p>

<p>The cook heard my note of temper, and refused
the giant admittance to his galley's sacred precincts,
whereupon Yellow Dog seized him by the scruff of
the neck, and tossed him into the lee scuppers. He
was about to pitch a pot of hot water on top of
him, but I interposed an objection to this action in
the shape of a belaying pin which, flung by my right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
arm under full swing, struck Yellow Dog fairly
upon the skull-cap, and, bounding off, flew overboard.</p>

<p>The giant staggered, caught himself from falling,
then he stood very straight, and gave me a look
that for cold fury expressed more than I had ever
dreamed possible in a Chink.</p>

<p>"Killee you fo' that," he hissed.</p>

<p>"Go on, do your killing, Yellow Dog," I snapped.
"But take care you don't get something yourself&mdash;and
the next time I speak to you aboard here, if you
don't answer at once you'll find something else
bounding off your dome that you'll remember for
a long time. Now send your mess kids to that galley,
and the cook will hand you out your rice and
long-lick."</p>

<p>The men of my watch stopped work where they
were, and grinned at the big Chinaman. Their contempt
for the race was more than my own, and I
knew I had the hearty approval of the sailors. At
the same time I was sorry that the thing had happened,
for the Chinamen who were already on deck
passed the word along, and by the time I had finished
talking the whole gang of them were standing
about, with looks upon their faces that told
of trouble.</p>

<p>It was a bad beginning for a long voyage.</p>

<p>Gantline came on deck as soon as he could finish
his dinner, and wanted to know what the trouble
was about, but that was all he said. He found
no fault with my remarks nor with my actions. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
ship's officer must maintain discipline, and discipline
cannot be maintained without respect.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald came up with her aunt, and I
went below to my dinner. As I passed the door of
the forward house leading into the cabin, the stout
Chink who seemed to be a close chum of the big
leader glared at me. He had a sinister face, with
little slits of eyes that looked slantwise, like the eyes
of a wolf.</p>

<p>His moustaches were thin and straight along his
lip, until they reached the corners of his wide mouth,
then they suddenly dropped straight down, and hung
like the tusks of a walrus, two thin, black points of
hair about six inches long. They gave him the appearance
of some carnivorous animal, fierce, saturnine
and dangerous.</p>

<p>Instead of slamming him for his insolence, I pretended
not to see him, and passed in, yet the look
stayed with me, and I remembered it at intervals.
He was a wolf, all right, a human wolf&mdash;but I was
to find that out later.</p>

<p>"What do you think of our passengers&mdash;the
coolies?" I asked Jack, the steward, who sat at my
mess next the carpenter, Oleson.</p>

<p>"Watch them, Mr. Garnett, watch them," he
warned. "I've seen some mighty bad Chinks leaving
the coast lately. These men belong to tongs&mdash;hatchet
men&mdash;and if you'll take my word for it you
will find plenty of long, black-barreled guns tucked
somewhere in their dunnage. But the hatchet is
their game for those they have a grudge against&mdash;hatchets
don't make a noise at night."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>"They won't get about the decks in my watch, to
use any hatchets, or guns, either, for that matter,"
I answered. "I'll tuck them in snug to bed at eight
bells."</p>

<p>"Hatchet's a bad thing at night," put in Oleson.
"I'll put a heavy staple on their door after they
turn in."</p>

<p>In my watch below I read ancient magazines until
I fell asleep. In my dreams I saw that stout Chinaman's
face with the pointed whiskers and slant eyes
peering down over me. In his hand was a little,
thin-bladed hatchet, like a tomahawk, and as I
reached up for him I awoke with a start, shivering
in spite of the heat.</p>

<p>The door of my cabin was closed, and my window,
or port, was but half open, sliding as it did
upon sills about five feet above the main deck.</p>

<p>A shadow passed even as I looked up, but when
I sprang out of my bunk and slammed the glass
open, there was nothing near the opening.</p>

<p>Just twenty or thirty feet distant forward two of
the crew were working on some gear, and the light
was still strong enough to recognize them as Jim
and Bill, of Slade's watch. Then the bells of the
dogwatch struck, and I went on deck, swearing at
myself for a nervous fool.</p>

<p>I refused to take a gun which hung over my bunk,
hating the idea of doing such a thing, for guns always
spelled trouble in all ships I had ever been in,
and I hated the idea of using one. I went on the
poop, and Miss MacDonald was sitting there with
her aunt, chatting with the old man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>"Keep her steady as she goes&mdash;sou'west half
west," said Gantline, as I came up.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," I answered, and was about to go
aft to the wheel, when the young lady spoke to me.</p>

<p>"I have just asked the captain to allow me to read
a chapter from the Bible to those Chinamen," she
said, "and, if you will assist me, we will gather
them close together on the deck there"&mdash;pointing to
the main deck. "I can stand upon the edge and
see them better. You don't know whether they can
speak or understand English, do you?"</p>

<p>"I think they understand me at times," I ventured,
"but I'm a bit doubtful about the kind of talk
you will toss them."</p>

<p>"Toss them? What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, I mean&mdash;well, they understand the kind
of English we use at times&mdash;I don't know how to
explain&mdash;it isn't a written language&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should sincerely hope not," said Miss MacDonald
meaningly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but, my dear, it is so expressive&mdash;I heard
you talking to them during dinner to-day," interrupted
her aunt.</p>

<p>I blushed a little. "Well, then, that's what I
mean," I said. "I don't want to say that I think
you are wasting time reading to them&mdash;you know
they have a religion of their own&mdash;one that antedates
ours&mdash;they won't take it right."</p>

<p>"That's a question we won't discuss at present,"
said Miss MacDonald. "There are many Christianized
Chinamen at home, and they seem to appreciate
it very much."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>"Always, if there's a pretty woman to teach
them," I snapped.</p>

<p>There was a silence after this. I had been rude,
I suppose, but I was only telling the truth. I went
to the break, or edge, of the schooner's poop, and
called the watch, which had been mustering on deck.</p>

<p>"Get the coolies aft to the mast," I ordered.</p>

<p>The men passed the word along, and two or three
Chinks who understood English as well as I did
came slouching aft. Gradually about two dozen
stood or congregated near enough to hear, but Yellow
Dog and his slant-eyed chum of the walrus
mustaches seemed to decline the invitation.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you get the large man, their leader, to
come also?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"Not without dragging him lashed fast," I protested.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, with just a bit of temper
in her voice.</p>

<p>Gantline had gone below, and I was in charge of
the deck until supper was over. The reading would
not take long, and the steward was already bringing
the cabin mess aft along the gangway. The
young lady read calmly, and with a peculiarly sweet
voice, that attracted the attention of the men, but
not of the coolies.</p>

<p>The Chinks stood about, and some gazed out over
the sea, some grinned openly up at her, with a smile
that told of tolerance for an imbecile. Miss MacDonald,
senior, went below to prepare for supper.</p>

<p>Before the girl had finished, Yellow Dog came
aft, and gazed at her in open admiration. He made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
some remark to his stout friend, and they both
smiled sardonically, but their attitude was not particularly
offensive.</p>

<p>I found some business at the spanker sheet, and
when I came forward to where the girl stood, she
was finishing.</p>

<p>"There is only one way to treat heathen, Mr. Garnett,"
she said, "and that is to be always kind, universally
even-tempered, and gentle with them. They
have had a hard road for many generations, and
take to kindness, as all lower creatures do. They
will only get stubborn if you use hard words and
roughness. I know something about their habits,
for I've taught the school at home, where we had
twenty pupils, all grown men."</p>

<p>At this I protested. I confess I was hot.</p>

<p>"If you are kind to them they will think you're
afraid of them," I declared. "If you mule-lick
them, hog-strap them, and generally beat the devil
out of them, they'll do as you tell them&mdash;not otherwise.
I'm not running a school aboard here, if you
please, and while I will give you any assistance you
want or can get, I go on the log right now that as
far as we handle these men, we must beat them and
lick them into submission. There's no other way at
sea. It's brutal, but the other way will turn out
more brutal. I'm not responsible for them being in
this ship&mdash;but I'll see they get to their port of discharge,
all right, if I have to flay them alive!"</p>

<p>"I think you are perfectly horrible&mdash;perfectly,
brutal to say such things," said Miss MacDonald.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
"Are all seamen brutes? Does the captain stand
for such things aboard here?"</p>

<p>"There is only one way to do with cattle of this
sort," I insisted. "I don't want the job&mdash;I'd rather
run in a bunch of snakes. But a ship's bound to be
run the way ships are run. There isn't any new
way to run a ship, believe me. It's all been tried
out hundreds of years before you were born. Perhaps
some day, when we don't need ships, the
brotherly-love racket will work all right; but not
these days."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, anyhow," said the lady, "and
I'm amazed that a man of apparent intelligence
should say such things. You should do unto others
as you would have them do unto you&mdash;always."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I assented, somewhat nettled at the
idea that a young lady should give me points on
running a ship. "I always do, always do unto the
crew or those coolies the same as I would expect
them to do to me&mdash;if I was the same kind of rascal
they are&mdash;and if our places were exchanged. There
can be only one man in charge of the deck,
the watch officer, and he's responsible for everything
that happens. And if I would be so bold as
to give you a bit of advice, I should say to you, for
God's sake don't try any foolishness on those yellow-skins
while they are under my charge. It'll
only make trouble, and there'll be enough of that,
anyhow, by the way things look."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Miss Aline.</p>

<p>"I mean that Yellow Dog, as the skipper calls him,
that big Chink, is not liking ship's discipline already.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
If you will go near the door of the alleyway when
they open it you will smell the fumes of opium
strong enough to knock you down. They don't pretend
to obey orders, and the company makes us
carry them and take care of them like they were
babies. We can't even search them or offer any
kind of protest&mdash;they'd refuse to come if the contract
was not drawn that way."</p>

<p>"Well, be kind to them, be always lenient with
them," said Miss Aline, in a tone so different, so
pleading that I gave up. "Don't yell at them like
I heard you to-day. It isn't dignified, it isn't right&mdash;you
will be good to them, now, won't you?&mdash;just
try it and see if it don't work."</p>

<p>"Ho, well, I'll try to do the best I can, of course,"
I answered, thinking of the stout pirate with the
hangers. "Yes, I'll try to be just as kind as I possibly
can&mdash;of course, I'll promise you that&mdash;that's
the skipper's orders, you know."</p>

<p>The steward had already brought the mess things
for the cabin, and the lady went below to join her
aunt and the old man&mdash;and Slade. The mate was
not standing for my line of talk, as I could see by
the way Miss Aline spoke, and it made me warm to
think that a mate of Slade's attainments should be
so mushy as to snicker and grin when I told him
how things stood.</p>

<p>"'Keep solid with the passengers'&mdash;that's one of
the old rules in the express steamers, you know&mdash;'keep
right with the ladies,'" he said, grinning at
me when I mentioned the missionary work the
young lady had undertaken. "And, by the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
lend me a couple of your clean collars&mdash;you won't
need them right away, and I do."</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the kind," I answered shortly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't get rattled because I've got the inside
route. Don't be mad, old man, because I've gained
the weather of you. All's fair in the game. And
between you and me, if the Chink gets gay with you,
bang him on the nut for fair, and I'll slip in with
you&mdash;if it's dark. But you don't want to queer me
below. Now, be sane, and come across with those
collars. I'm young and single&mdash;and mate, see?"</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" I answered, but I knew Slade
would go to my room, instead, and nail those white-laundered
collars I had kept clean.</p>

<p>That night, when I turned in, I found that, indeed,
Slade had been below, and had rummaged my
things about most unkindly, taking my linen. I
turned in with a feeling of resentment at his luck
in position, but I dismissed the feeling quickly as the
absurdity of the affair dawned upon me, for, after
all, I was not thinking of women at all, and had
no right to under the present high salary I was
drawing.</p>

<p>Rolling into my bunk, I was instantly asleep. In
my dreams I saw that walrus-looking Chink. His
long black feelers hung down over me, the points
piercing my vitals like tusks. I gave a yell and
awoke!</p>

<p>The lamp was burning dimly, as it always did in
my room at night, ready for the sudden call to the
deck, and I could see everything distinctly the moment
I opened my eyes. A face was just leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the glass of my window. I sprang out of the bunk,
and peered out through the glass. At that instant
there was a heavy rat-tat-tat upon the door, and the
voice of Jim Douglas, of Slade's watch, called to
me that it was eight bells, and time to turn out. I
threw open the door.</p>

<p>"Did you look in through my window?" I asked
him.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I wouldn't do anything like that, sir,"
said the seaman.</p>

<p>He was a good-looking young Scotchman of
twenty-four, tall and strong, with an honest face.
I knew he was telling the truth.</p>

<p>"That's all," I said, and he went on his way.</p>

<p>I looked at the gun that hung over my shelf at
the bunk head. It was one I took off a dago named
Louis, of my watch, and it was a heavy gun, forty-five
caliber, and long in the barrel.</p>

<p>"Perfectly absurd to think of it," I muttered to
myself. I pulled on my coat, and started for the
deck, when something, some instinct, told me to take
the weapon.</p>

<p>"Sentiment be hanged!" I said out loud, and
tucked the revolver in a rear pocket. Then I made
the deck, and found Slade standing at the mizzen
waiting for me.</p>

<p>"We'll raise the land before morning," said he.
"She's been running like a scared rat all night.
Keep a lookout, and when you sight anything sing
out to the old man&mdash;he'll be on deck probably, but
he's been acting queer lately, and you better watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
him. We'll heave her to for a pilot, and you know
the rest."</p>

<p>"All right," I answered.</p>

<p>The soft, damp air of the trade wind made the
decks soaking wet. The low hum through the rigging
added to the murmuring of the side wash. The
creaking of sheet blocks and slight straining of the
gear were the only noises that broke the stillness
of the peaceful night. The schooner was running
along rapidly, heeling gently to the wind, and everything
drawing. The rolling motion was slight, for
the wind was strong enough to hold her steady.</p>

<p>The voices of the watch forward sounded above
the murmuring, and I could see the glow of a pipe
belonging to some one who disregarded the ship's
discipline sufficiently to smoke while on duty. I
took my place at the mizzen rigging to con the
vessel, and stood there silently for a long time
watching the foam rushing past her, now and then
gazing far ahead to see if I could raise the lights
of Pearl Harbor. The wind was almost astern, and
the headsails were consequently not doing much
work. I listened to the slatting, and then sang out:</p>

<p>"Haul down the jib topsail and roll it up."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," came the response, and the men
went to the forecastle head.</p>

<p>Aft at the wheel the shadow of a man holding
the spokes was the only sign of life on deck. I
took my place again at the weather rigging, and
waited for the report from forward.</p>

<p>A heavier swell than usual rolled the schooner,
and I turned to look aft. At that instant something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
whizzed past my ear, and struck with a chugging
sound into the backstay. My ear stung sharply, and
something warm ran down my neck. I saw a form
vanish behind the mast, and called out.</p>

<p>I knew I had been struck, and drew my gun,
springing toward the figure, which dashed silently
across the deck as I gained the mast. I fired at
it without hesitation, and the fellow let out a scream,
gained the rail, and plunged over the side.</p>

<p>I was at the rail in an instant, but saw nothing
in the foam. A moment's silence followed, and then
a sound of steps and a rising murmur of voices told
me of the alarm.</p>

<p>Gantline was on deck in less time than it takes
to tell it, and he roared out: "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Slade sprang from the door of the forward cabin,
calling out that he was coming. Men from forward
rushed aft. Then, from out of the doors of
the alleyways, a stream of figures poured forth,
flowing like a black tide onto the main deck. A
sudden roar of voices followed, and I recognized
the high-pitched tones of our coolies.</p>

<p>"All hands&mdash;help! All hands aft&mdash;quick!" I
yelled, and fired into the black figures who swarmed
up the poop and crowded upon me.</p>

<p>As I fired, I heard the shrill screams of the elder
Miss MacDonald, and then there was indiscriminate
firing. I yelled to Slade, and he answered once.
The crowd surged over me, and I was down, with
a dozen panting heathens on top of me. In a minute
it was all over. Some one passed a line about my
arms, and, kick as I might, they soon had me snug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and fast. Gantline roared out orders from the
wheel, and I heard the crack of a pistol at rapid intervals.
Then a roaring, surging mob rolled over
him&mdash;and there was the schooner luffing to under
full sail, her head sheets thrashing and the canvas
thundering in the stiff breeze.</p>

<p>They had taken her. We were overpowered, all
right. The men forward stood it out but a moment
longer, and surrendered.</p>

<p>When I could see again I noticed the giant form
of Yellow Dog standing near the wheel, and two of
his men at the wheel spokes. He sang out orders
in his musical bass voice, and the sheets were quickly
trimmed in. The schooner now headed well up with
the wind abeam, and pointed away across the Pacific,
far to the northward of Hawaii. Yellow Dog
had taken her easily.</p>

<p>I was hauled below, and tossed into the forward
cabin. Here I found Slade lashed fast, like myself.
He was hurt by a bullet that had torn his thigh,
and was bleeding. Upon a transom lay Gantline,
trussed from head to foot in line, and the old skipper
was swearing fiercely at the ill fortune that had
overtaken his ship.</p>

<p>I noticed a few Chinks standing near the door of
the after cabin, and they looked at us casually, seeming
to regard us not at all. Then I heard the soft
voice of Miss Aline pleading with Yellow Dog. But
of course she might have pleaded with the sea with
as much effect. Then the sounds died away, and we
lay there, waiting for daylight and what might
follow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>Daylight came, and the schooner still held her
way under all sail except the jib topsail that I had
hauled down before the fracas. She now lay at a
sharp angle, and felt the trade wind upon her starboard
beam.</p>

<p>Yellow Dog came into the forward cabin. He
stopped a moment near me, then kicked me savagely,
muttering strange sounds in his own language. I
told him fluently in good seaman's English just what
I thought of him, and if he did not understand me
he was something dense, for I've had every kind of
human under the sun on my ship's deck, and I have
so far failed to notice any who could not understand
me when I let off a few pieces of literature or
oratory.</p>

<p>Yellow Dog seemed rather pleased than otherwise,
for he called his man, the walrus-mustached
one, and grinned while they held a confab. I took
it that something choice would be handed me within
a very short time.</p>

<p>When I had a chance to ask the skipper, he told
us we were within forty miles of Pearl Harbor.
From the way we nosed into the breeze, the
schooner was now heading northwest across the
ocean, giving the harbor a wide berth.</p>

<p>"What'll they do?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Sink her, with us aboard&mdash;take the ten thousand
dollars in the safe, and make a get-away with
it. They'll turn up ashore in some deserted place,
and that'll be about all. Then they'll divide the
swag, separate, and Yellow Dog will go his way&mdash;probably
back to China. It's not much money when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
you think of it for a white man, but it's a whole
heap for a Chink."</p>

<p>After the day had well advanced we heard noises
on deck. The foresail was lowered, or, rather, let
go by the run, the noise of tearing gear sounding
plainly. Topsails, staysails, and everything forward
except the jib were cut away. Then the spanker
was lowered, and left threshing about, half up, with
the sheet hauled amidships. The jib was hauled
to the mast, and the schooner lay hove to in the
trade swell, riding easily upon the sea, and remaining
very steady.</p>

<p>We heard them getting out the boats, and there
was much noise from aft where the safe was fast
to the deck in the captain's cabin. Finally a terrific
explosion took place there, and after that the noises
died away.</p>

<p>"Blew it," said Slade.</p>

<p>A smell of smoke now began to be apparently in
the confined air of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Are they going to fire us?" asked
the mate.</p>

<p>"Safest way, I suppose. Knock a hole in her
bottom first, set her on fire, and then get out," I
said.</p>

<p>"But the girl?" asked Slade.</p>

<p>"Oh, Yellow Dog will take care of her&mdash;probably
take her along with him in the boats."</p>

<p>"Not if I know it. Man, do you know what that
means?" he panted, straining at his wrist lashings.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a mighty bad outlook, but if you can
stop it, sing out; I'll help," I said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>The smoke grew more dense in the confined
space. The noise of hoisting gear died away, and
the shouts of men from a distance told that they
already had the small boats over, and were alongside.</p>

<p>Slade strained away at his lines, and I did, also,
but we were fast. Gantline muttered on the transom,
and began to choke with the smoke. Suddenly
a form burst into the room. It was Oleson, the
carpenter. He slashed at our lashings with a heavy
knife, and in a moment we were free.</p>

<p>We dragged ourselves out on deck, crawling to
keep below the rail, so that we could not be seen
from the small boats. Two forms lay right in front
of a door&mdash;two of our men who had been killed.
Not a sign of a wounded Chink, or dead one, either.
They had taken them along if there were any.</p>

<p>"I cut loose," said Oleson; "rubbed the lashings
on a broken bottle they left on deck near me.
They've knocked a few holes in her, and it's up to
us to stop them up before the schooner sinks. She's
on fire forward&mdash;whole barrel of oil poured over
her decks and lit up before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Looks like they have her either way, then," said
Gantline. "But we'll try the fire first, and take a
chance at her settling under us."</p>

<p>I peeped over the rail and saw the boats&mdash;three
of them&mdash;about a mile distant. Then Slade and I
ran below aft. The two passengers had apparently
gone with them, and the cabin was empty. Gantline,
with Oleson and six men left alive aboard,
fought the fire, and we joined them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>Half an hour's work and we had the fire out, but
it had played the mischief with the running gear,
having burned up plenty of line that lay on the
deck. Oleson and Slade went below forward, while
Gantline and I went after to find where they had
knocked holes in her bottom.</p>

<p>The sound of rushing water told us the position
of the leak almost before we reached the lower
deck. They had not done much of a job, having cut
squarely into her just below the water line, trusting
to the fire to finish their work for them.</p>

<p>Calling all hands, we jammed a mattress into the
hole, and then passed a tarpaulin down on the outside.
Oleson spiked planks over the wad, and we
had a fair stopper on the place. Then we set to
work to get the canvas on her.</p>

<p>Yellow Dog, finding that the schooner was not
burning quickly, put back in his boat to see what
the trouble was. We were then at the gear, and he
soon saw us. His men sent the boat along with a
will, and they drew close aboard in a few minutes.</p>

<p>We were now without arms, and he seemed to be
satisfied that he would get us without trouble. It
was blowing fresh, and the schooner was drifting
bodily to leeward.</p>

<p>We crammed the oil-soaked stuff from her decks
into the donkey boiler, and as the fire was already
burning, and steam was almost up, we waited, while
some of us hoisted the headsails and swung her
head off before the wind. The mizzen was swayed
up, and in a few minutes the schooner was under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
good headway, sliding along at four or five knots,
and keeping the boat at a distance.</p>

<p>"Now, then, my hearty, we'll soon fix you," said
Gantline.</p>

<p>Between moments of desperate work we had a
chance to see that the other boats were also coming
back after us. At the present rate we were
holding our own, and Yellow Dog stood no chance
to catch us, but he kept on, and managed to get
within a couple of hundred yards.</p>

<p>From here he opened fire upon us with the heavy
six-shooters, and we heard the spat of the lead in
the canvas, but for ourselves we kept below the rail,
and the power of a revolver was not enough to
bother us exceedingly.</p>

<p>Soon Oleson announced that we could put the
halyards to the winches, and we sent the foresail
and mainsail up in no time. Then we set the
spanker and had all the lower canvas on her.</p>

<p>The schooner lay well over under the pressure,
and we sent her along a good ten knots, while we
cleared up the gear and made things shipshape. The
boats were soon black specks in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Now, then, let's get to work on that yellow boy
right," said the old man.</p>

<p>"No, don't let him get too far away from us,"
said Slade. "The two ladies are in that boat with
the big Chink, and we better attend to it first."</p>

<p>We hauled our wind and began reaching back,
the boat with Yellow Dog being kept right under the
jibboom end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>"I reckon I'll take the wheel and you go forward,
Mr. Garnett," said Gantline.</p>

<p>"Will you run him down?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Without any mistake at all&mdash;if you'll give me
the course right when he gets in close," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"But the ladies, the passengers?" said Slade.</p>

<p>"We'll do the best we can for them&mdash;just as well
to get killed that way as to get away with those
fellows, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The men took to the idea at once, and we grouped
close under the shelter of the windlass, watching
the schooner run. She was going a full ten, and
rising and falling with a rhythmic motion, her side,
where the patch was, being almost clear of the sea.</p>

<p>Yellow Dog saw us, and knew what we intended
to do. He swung his boat around and pulled dead
into the wind's eye, knowing that if we missed
him we would not get a chance to strike again until
we beat well up to windward of him. He would
make it warm on deck as we came close, and Gantline
took the precaution to place a few boards
against the binnacle, so that he could crouch behind
them when the firing began. I was to wave my
hand which way he should steer, and he was to keep
me in sight readily.</p>

<p>We drew rapidly up to the boat. Yellow Dog
stood up in the stern, and held a long, black-barreled
revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>We crouched lower, and the schooner bore down
upon the boat. I waved my hand to starboard, and
Gantline gave her a few spokes. Yellow Dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
backed water, and the boat would have gone clear
of the cutwater, but at that instant a heavier puff
of wind heeled the schooner over, and she luffed to
a trifle, her cutwater rising upon a swell.</p>

<p>Then, with the downward plunge, she shored
through the small boat, striking it fairly amidships.</p>

<p>I was so taken up with the affair that I poked
my head too far over the rail, and a bullet ripped
my cheek open, knocking me head over heels with
the shock.</p>

<p>I scrambled to my feet, furious with the pain and
excitement. The fragments of the small boat drifted
alongside, the after part going to leeward, and dragging
along the channels. I saw Slade spring upon
the rail for an instant, and then plunge overboard.</p>

<p>Holding my bleeding face with one hand, I ran
to the forechannels, and saw Yellow Dog grasp the
chains as they washed past. He had a mighty grip,
and that hand hold of his was a wonder. He drew
himself into the chains, and, without waiting, clambered
up and over the rail, springing to the deck
right in front of me as I backed away.</p>

<p>Oleson saw him coming, and so did a seaman
named Wales. The three of us closed on him, and
dragged him down, and we rolled in the lee scuppers,
a fighting, snarling pile of humanity, while Gantline
let the wheel go, and ran to help us.</p>

<p>Yellow Dog tossed the three of us off with the
ease of a man throwing aside children, and would
have taken charge in another moment, but Gantline,
running up behind him with a handspike, swung the
bar down with full force upon that little skullcap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and the giant Chink stretched out harmless. We
had him trussed before the schooner had stopped
her headway into the breeze.</p>

<p>Then we ran to the side, and looked for Slade.
He was swimming easily about a hundred yards
astern, holding the form of Miss Aline with one
hand, and keeping her head clear of the water. All
about were the forms of swimming Chinamen.</p>

<p>Quickly backing the headsails, we sent the
schooner astern, drifting down upon the mate. I
made a line fast to a life buoy, and flung it far out.
After what seemed a long time, we finally had the
mate fast to it, and were hauling him in. Soon he
was taken aboard, and Miss MacDonald was carried
below. Then we went to work trying to pick
up the Chinks.</p>

<p>Many of these refused to come aboard, preferring
to die in the sea. Some we caught and dragged up
forcibly. We caught most of them, and then hauled
our wind for the two boats that were now almost
out of sight.</p>

<p>Within a couple of hours we had the first alongside,
and she surrendered. In it was Miss Aline's
aunt, and she was passed below insensible. The
other boat took longer to get, but we finally got her
alongside, and the men out of her. Forty-seven
Chinks stood the muster. We had lost ten of them
and two of our men in the fracas. Miss MacDonald
came out of her faint, and from her room,
where she had locked herself. She fell into the
arms of her niece.</p>

<p>"Oh, the brave men, those romantic sailors, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
heroes!" she cried, in an ecstasy of joy, and she
gave me a look worth millions.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Miss Aline. "Perhaps if those
heroes had been a little more gentle there would
have been no trouble&mdash;but I am glad we are saved.
Mr. Slade risked his life for me."</p>

<p>The Kanaka cook crawled from the lower hold,
where he had hidden at the first outcry, and the
stewardess came from the lazaret. We came into
Honolulu that evening with the police flag flying,
and turned the big Chink over to the authorities for
treatment. His lieutenant of the walrus mustaches
was missing.</p>

<p>Miss Aline came on deck to look around. She
saw Slade, and went to him. What she said to him
was none of my business, but Slade was a good
man and a good mate. Afterward she came to the
mizzen where I stood like a bandaged soldier.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll not make the rest of the voyage
with us?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I don't know; maybe you don't care so
much for the heathen. Brotherly love and kindness&mdash;fine
theory, all right, but we're not just ready to
put it in practice&mdash;willing to wait, you know, until
it comes our way&mdash;perhaps a bit afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are very much mistaken, sir," she broke in.
"You will find out your error, too, I think, before
we get through. I am firmly convinced that your
own actions with that poor heathen are as much at
fault as his, and that if you had not treated him
so roughly he would never have done what he did."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>I grinned. I couldn't help it. Slade was winking
at me from the door of the forward house. Oh,
well, here was a good woman gone wrong in her
theories, and I would not be insolent enough to disagree
with her. I let it go at that. I was willing
to wait until she had finished the voyage&mdash;for
Slade's sake. He was a sly dog, that Slade.</p>

<p>We found about two thousand dollars of the
money taken among the men captured. The rest
was a total loss, and Gantline bemoaned his fate, as
it fell upon him to a certain extent.</p>

<p>We cleared, leaving the big Chinaman to stand
trial with two others as accessories, and the police
absolved me absolutely from all blame in the matter.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">PART II</h2></div>


<p>"No loafing around the ship," I called to the little yellow chap who
was sitting near the spring line which held the schooner <i>Tanner</i> to
the wharf at Honolulu. The man paid not the slightest attention to me.</p>

<p>"Hey, there, sonny! Move out! Beat it; make a getaway, you savvy?" I
bawled in a louder tone.</p>

<p>Then he arose, and instead of a young fellow I was amazed to find him
at least ten years older than myself&mdash;and I had been a ship's officer
some years. He walked slowly to the vessel's side, and gazed up at me
where I stood near the break of the poop, holding to a backstay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>She was a modern, short-poop schooner. The sallow little man was not
a Chinaman, nor of Kanaka breed, but a full-blooded Japanese. He was
stout, strong, yellow of skin, and his black hair was too long for his
country's custom, sticking out from under the rim of a brown derby that
had seen its best days. His eyes were slitlike, keen little eyes, but
there was nothing repulsive in them. They attracted me. For one thing,
he had an open frankness, an honest and fearless look, and his face was
sad.</p>

<p>"What you doin' on the dock, Togi?" I asked, eying him humorously.</p>

<p>"If your august presence will listen, I'll tell you," he answered
easily.</p>

<p>"Sure, Michael, let her go, and don't mind my gigantic&mdash;er&mdash;august
self," I sniggered.</p>

<p>"In the first place," he said, "I'm not sonny, being, if your honorable
temper allows, a man of forty. If fine schooner says so, I go with
you as far as Tokyo. There I am the humble cousin of the Honorable
Baron Komuri, son of a Samurai, under the former emperor. I should
like indeed to sail with you, and will&mdash;&mdash;" Here he stopped a moment,
hesitating.</p>

<p>"Go on, king, old man; don't let anything stop you from telling your
yarn. Sing it out, and I'll listen if it breaks a bone."</p>

<p>"No, no; not king, old man; just Mister Komuri&mdash;if your presence allows
me to correct. Your humble servant is but a plain man. Better be plain
man than dead lion, as your excellent books say. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> accept plain man,
and go that way if so ship says."</p>

<p>"We are not going to Tokyo, but if you see the skipper he'll take you
clear to Manila for a hundred or two yen. You savvy him yen. Must pay,
you know."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is of what I wish to tell your honorable self. Allow me to
make myself so humble to tell I have not the yen you ask. I have not
anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, kiddo; on your way," I said remorselessly.</p>

<p>"But I sit on dock end waiting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Waiting for what?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for two hundred yen to fly up and knock me dead. I wait and no
yen fly up to strike me on the cranium. Now I go with fine ship, and
work like plain man."</p>

<p>"You have a sense of humor, king," said I, "and sink me if I don't try
to get you a job wrastling the dishes aft. How about it? Can you sling
the pots&mdash;are you a number-one pot-wrastler?"</p>

<p>"I never wrastle; a little jujutsu sometimes when necessary for take
care, but I work at anything your august self tells. If honorable
commander tells me to wrastle pots, I try him so. I pretty good with
sword or short knife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, king; this isn't a man-of-war; no fighting here. All the
fracasing done here is done by my august self and the other mate, Mr.
Bill Slade, both, as you say, honorable men, and some hustlers when it
comes right down to handling cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> in a blow. What I want&mdash;honorable
ship wants&mdash;is a man to give the eats aft&mdash;savvy? Bring in the hash
from honorable cook in galley&mdash;see? Set dish on table, wash dish off
table. You know."</p>

<p>"But I am soldier&mdash;son of Samurai. I do not like dishwork; but if no
other way, I do mean work to get to Tokyo," he said sadly.</p>

<p>"You're on," I hastened to say. "You're on, king, but in the future you
will be known as Koko. Savvy?"</p>

<p>"As Mister Komuri," he interrupted, with a look from those slits of
eyes that called my attention.</p>

<p>"No misters aboard here but my honorable self and mate. Rules of
honorable ship, you know. Sorry, but august skipper has discipline,
and you are soldier. You savvy? We'll compromise on Komuri. How's
that&mdash;just plain Komuri, steward, hash boy, hey?"</p>

<p>"Your august self, yes; to common men, Mister Komuri, yes."</p>

<p>"Get aboard, then," I said. "Go forward to the galley. The cook&mdash;that
big Kanaka there&mdash;he'll give you the line. In the meantime I'll square
it with the boss."</p>

<p>Mister Komuri sprang over the rail, and made his way as directed. It
was easy to see that he had been in ships before, as what Japanese
hasn't, since they are a race of seamen.</p>

<p>Our new member took hold without further orders, and I saw him not
again until the land was well astern, and we were on our way to Guam,
with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>forty-seven chink coolies below, and two lady passengers aft.</p>

<p>This was the second part of our run, the first being from Frisco, where
we had shipped the coolies under the leadership of their gigantic
foreman, who had tried to take the ship and landed in jail for his
pains. The few thousand dollars we now carried in the safe aft was not
worthy of anxiety in regard to protection. Our voyage promised to be
uneventful.</p>

<p>Among our crew were two new hands we had shipped at Honolulu to
help run the ship, also to take care of the Chinese we carried. Our
experience with the coolies had taught us that being short-handed was
not either good or safe. Our arms were now ready, being, as they were,
riot guns full of buckshot, and reliable six-shooters of heavy caliber.
This going out with nearly half a hundred Chinks with but three men in
a watch was all right if the Chinks were good, but we had found they
were not to be trusted. With the leader of the uprising in jail for
murder, and his lieutenant killed, we hoped for an easy life.</p>

<p>We now had four men in watch, with the engineer for the ever-ready
steam winch bunking in his engine house with banked fires and enough
steam always ready to handle line. We were really carrying a full crew
for a schooner, and the expense of the engine was extra, there being
now enough men to handle her canvas easily without the aid of the
winches.</p>

<p>One of the new men was a strange-looking fellow, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>who was neither dago
nor Dutchman. Just what he was I don't know, except that he was crafty,
watchful, and dodged all work possible. He had a way of looking at you
with eyes that seemed to fathom your inmost thoughts, an affected way
of appearing to understand, and his peculiar silences gave support to
the look. It deceived the old man.</p>

<p>It deceived both Slade and myself at first, but afterward we grew more
discerning, peered deeper into his meaning, and saw&mdash;nothing. He was
just a petty, crafty sea lawyer who was looking for trouble to carry
back to the coast, where they love to get masters and mates mixed up in
courts for some violation of the shipping articles.</p>

<p>This fellow's name was Dodd&mdash;Alfred Dodd&mdash;and he was called Alf by his
shipmates. Komuri seemed to sense danger the moment he jostled the
seaman in the gangway the first day out. I heard the row from the deck,
and it was short.</p>

<p>"Hey, Jack," yelled Dodd to the regular steward we had signed on in
Frisco, "Jack, you seem to belong to the nobility now&mdash;can't hand a man
a pot of coffee during the mid-watch no more, hey? Let the king do it."</p>

<p>"Not king; just plain Mister Komuri," purred our little helper, as he
grinned.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Dodd. "Don't four-flush at your title, hey?"</p>

<p>"Aw, give us rest," said Jack, who was good-natured and liked the
little yellow man, for Komuri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> did all his work now, and there was no
comeback.</p>

<p>"I don't know if honorable sailor means wrong by four-flush," said
Komuri quietly, "but if he does the finger of Fate will point at him."</p>

<p>"Wow! Fate will point at me! What der you think o' that?" sneered Dodd.
"Let's hope you ain't Fate, sonny, or I might p'int my own fair hand at
you in return."</p>

<p>"If honorable seaman will step out to the fore end of ship I'll show
him just what a son of Samurai means. It will take short time."</p>

<p>"Sure, king; I'll go you that explanation, all right. Come right along
while the watch are getting their whack. No one will notice us."</p>

<p>Komuri jumped like a tiger without warning. He sprang upon the fellow,
and had a strangle hold of his wrist, and twisted over his neck until
I thought he was getting killed. I had to stop laughing to run up and
stop the fracas. Dodd was sweating with pain, and cursing furiously,
absolutely helpless. It was so quickly done that I wondered at it. Of
course, a strong man might grab the small fellow and jerk him out of
his shoes, but that was not Dodd.</p>

<p>"Drop it!" I commanded, and the second steward let go at once, smiling.
"Now, get below, and quit this fooling," said I, and the sailor waited
for no further orders. "You can show me some of your tricks, you
Japanese juggler, when we have more time," I said to the little man.
"You interest me considerable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> Get to the hash, and don't waste time
with a fool like that."</p>

<p>Of course, it might be expected that a man of Komuri's parts would be
gallant, for it seems always the case when a man is able and unafraid
that he is sure to love with more passion than discernment. Komuri was
not an exception.</p>

<p>Not being at the first table with the passengers, I had small
opportunity to see how he treated Miss MacDonald, but from what Slade
told me I was concerned. The small chap was always in attendance upon
the ladies when they were on deck. He was politeness itself, and he
busied himself with all kinds of little efforts to make them more
comfortable than they were.</p>

<p>"If honorable ladies will allow, I fix the rugs in chairs," he would
say, and although the weather was tropical, a rug made a softer seat
when they took the air on deck, which they did nearly all daytime while
we ran our westing down beneath the tropic of Cancer.</p>

<p>With a good full month or six weeks before us, and a fair wind on the
starboard quarter all the time, we had a stretch of water to cross
that put one in mind of steamers. The ship ran steadily day and night
at about from eight to ten knots an hour. We seldom touched a sheet
or halyard except to set it up, and the gentle heeling with the trade
swell made the voyage seem like a yachting trip.</p>

<p>Komuri had much time to devote to the comfort of the ladies, and the
elder one seemed to like him very much indeed. He told them stories of
the warlike Samurai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> and honor and self-respect stood out plainly in
them all. It was not a bad thing, except that he always seemed to be
something of a hero, and no steward either second or first should be
such a thing where there are seamen around waiting for the job.</p>

<p>"I have always believed that you heathen were very able people," said
Miss Aline, "and if you were treated properly you would be just as
gentle and tractable as the European races."</p>

<p>"Heathen," said Komuri calmly, "are those who do not accept your own
honorable views. Who knows which is right? It is a word we never use in
Japan."</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment, and said: "You are quite incorrigible. I
hope you are not really bad, after all."</p>

<p>"Honorable lady must see by how I do&mdash;not how I talk; she judge humble
self most true. Her heart right," said the Japanese, which I thought
was going some for a second steward, especially when I remembered how
Slade stood, or wished to stand, in a certain quarter. I thought it
best to let the humble steward see he was going far enough.</p>

<p>"Say, king, old man," I interrupted, "Jack wants you to get busy with
the potatoes for dinner. He's waiting for the peelings."</p>

<p>Komuri nodded to me respectfully.</p>

<p>"At once, august mate, I go," he said, and went.</p>

<p>"Quite a superior steward, that Japanese boy," said the elder lady to
me.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a wonder, all right," I assented; "but his place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> is in the
galley, and not on the quarter-deck&mdash;if I may be allowed to speak of
it."</p>

<p>"And I do hope you will treat him kindly&mdash;not as you did the Chinese
man who went bad," said Miss Aline.</p>

<p>"No fear of it&mdash;not the king. He wouldn't stand roughing&mdash;and don't
call for it. You see, while he goes with the Chinks altogether too much
for their own good, and talks altogether too much for his own, he is
not a Chinaman. Oh, no; he is far removed from the coolie Chinks, as
far as the skipper himself. He's just a plain little fighting man, that
a good-sized mate like myself could bite in two; but I know him&mdash;just
what he'd do."</p>

<p>"Why, what?" asked Miss Aline.</p>

<p>"I'd hate to tell you," I grinned.</p>

<p>"You may be a good seaman, but you're somewhat stupid," said Miss
Aline, and I laughed outright at her humor.</p>

<p>"What do you think of this fine weather?" asked her aunt to change the
conversation.</p>

<p>"It's good as it goes, but it's the hurricane season, and we can't
count on it lasting all the way, you know," I said. "Maybe we'll hook
right into a typhoon before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you always want something rough, something bad," put in Miss
Aline. "I never saw such a man. Why do you always look for trouble?
Don't you find it often enough without hunting it always?"</p>

<p>"Sure as eggs," I said; "but I'm only telling you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> what I believe, what
the signs show me. I'm not trying to frighten you at all."</p>

<p>"I think you are perfectly horrid," said the young woman.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm wrong, at least," I answered. But as I scanned the perfect
sky I felt that indeed I was trespassing upon the feelings of the
passengers too much, in spite of the fact that I had a mercury glass to
observe in Slade's room.</p>

<p>The coolies came on deck in the daytime now, and sat in rows along the
waterways, eating their rice and chewing some sort of stuff to fill in
the interval between meals. They chattered a lot, and appeared not to
feel abashed at their former behavior.</p>

<p>At these times the old man would come on deck&mdash;it being about the time
he'd take the noon sight&mdash;and gaze down at them dismally. He hated
Chinks, and their presence in his ship was more than he could get used
to.</p>

<p>"What good are Chinks, anyway?" he would say.</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to do the work in hot countries, and you can't always
get the blacks. They are just like mules, carabao buffalo, or jacks.
They'll work on ten cents a day and get fat; they don't know any
better," I'd tell him.</p>

<p>But he would shake his old, shaggy head and mutter:</p>

<p>"What good, what good, anyway?"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they did no harm aboard besides befouling the air
of the alleyways with their eternal opium smoking. They had nothing at
all to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> with the men forward, and the only person who appeared to
be able to hold intercourse with them was Komuri. He understood their
lingo or singsong way of telling it, and he would talk to them for
hours during the evening after the supper things were washed up, and
Jack, the steward, had turned in.</p>

<p>I was a bit suspicious of this, for I don't like men of the after
guard to be intimate with either the crew or the passengers. It starts
something before long, and the voyage across the Pacific is a long one
if nothing else. Slade commented upon the Japanese often, and he rather
disliked our little second steward for his untiring efforts in behalf
of the ladies. Slade was a jealous man, although he was a seaman from
clew to earing, and his attentions to Miss Aline were more and more
marked as the schooner sped on her course.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I get married?" he used to say to me when we had a
chance to be together, which was seldom enough. "Why shouldn't I get a
wife, and take up the simple life of the farmer? I've been through all
the hardness of seagoing, and I'm tired of it. What is a man, after
all, if he sticks to it? He gets to be a skipper of some blamed hooker
that'll make him a couple of thousand a year when he is too old to
enjoy spending it. Then he loses her, maybe, and then where is he? A
fit subject, for the sailors' home. No, I'm going to marry that woman
and get a berth ashore. You watch me."</p>

<p>Of course, I encouraged him all I thought necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> I even grinned
at times when I thought of the picture he would make as a husband of a
woman like Miss Aline MacDonald&mdash;after he had been on the beach for a
year or two.</p>

<p>And so we ran our westing down, and drew near the one hundred and
sixtieth meridian to the northward of the Marshall Islands. Here the
trade failed us for a wonder, and began to get fitful and squally. At
times it would come with a rush, and then die away altogether, the
squalls being accompanied by rain. A mighty swell began to heave in
from the southeast diagonally across the trade swell, and it lumped up
some, heaving the schooner over and rolling her down to her bearings
when the wind failed to hold her.</p>

<p>The glass fell, and the air became sultry, the sun glowing like a ball
of red copper in the hazy atmosphere. The squall clouds grew heavier,
and when the sun shone between them it sent long rays, fan-shaped,
through the mist.</p>

<p>The old man came on deck, and viewed the sea with a critical eye. It
was nearly eight bells, and Slade was on watch. I came out and watched
them take the sun for meridian altitude&mdash;both of them sometimes did
this together&mdash;and when the bells struck off, Slade came down from the
poop, and joined me on the main deck.</p>

<p>"What'd you make of the weather, old man?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Looks dirty to me; glass falling and the hot squalls coming from that
quarter&mdash;whew! Look at it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>As I spoke a huge roller swept under the schooner, lifting her skyward,
and then dropping her slowly down the side. It was an enormous sea&mdash;a
hill of water full forty feet high&mdash;and it rolled like a living
mountain, a mighty mass that made nothing of the trade swell, and told
of some tremendous power behind it.</p>

<p>The sea ran swiftly, with a quick, live feeling. As sure as death there
was awful wind somewhere in that peaceful ocean, driving with immense
force and resistless power.</p>

<p>Slade looked askance at the topsails. As he gazed the old man sang out
from aft:</p>

<p>"Clew up the topsails and roll them up snug. Put extra gaskets on them!"</p>

<p>Then came the main and mizzen along with the outer jibs, and by the
time the watch had their dinner we were close reefing the mizzen and
taking the bonnet out of the foresail.</p>

<p>Miss Aline was on deck, as the sudden motion was so extraordinary that
to remain below meant to be seasick. Her aunt came up from a hasty
meal, and clung to the poop rail and watched us work.</p>

<p>"Oh, those gallant men!" she murmured to her niece. "See how they climb
like monkeys upon that awful sail. Romantic heroes! Yes, Aline, they
are wonderful, and the way that officer talks to them is a revelation.
Just hear him."</p>

<p>I was at that moment holding forth to a couple of squareheads upon
the evident virtues of passing reef points properly, and I may have
slipped my etiquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> a bit, for my language was such that I was almost
persuaded to follow it with action. But I had heard enough. I stopped.
The men went on lazily, growling at the work.</p>

<p>"Reefing a ship in a dead calm," grumbled one, "ten minutes for the
eats, and then we'll loose these here p'ints out ag'in, and take the
sail to the winch."</p>

<p>I was too angry to hear more. Here was an old lady putting me queer
with men who ought to know better than talk when they were expected to
hurry. At least they should not criticize their officers.</p>

<p>"Get along, you Scandaluvian sons of Haman! Get those points in lively,
or the squall'll break before you know it&mdash;an' I'll be the rain,
thunder, and lightning!" I roared.</p>

<p>I refused to look at the two passengers, and went to the forward end
of the poop, and looked down at the Chinks, who were seated in the
waterways eating their rice and long-lick&mdash;molasses. Just what to do
with these fellows seemed to me a problem. We could hardly lock them in
now, and if trouble came along quickly they would be in it, right in
the middle.</p>

<p>The old man came from below, and gazed solemnly across the misty sea,
and I went to him.</p>

<p>"How about it?" he asked. "Hadn't we better house them Chinks now,
before it's too late? They'll die of suffocation in those alleyways
with the ports shut fast&mdash;I suppose you shut the ports in, didn't you?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Sure. Everything is snugged in below. Komuri saw to it. He knows how
to talk to the Mongolians&mdash;tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> them they must keep the ports shut.
But I don't like leaving them on deck, even if it is hot enough to
roast potatoes on the deck planks. How's the glass, sir?"</p>

<p>"Bottom dropped out of it somehow; mercury concave and 'way down.
There's some unusual disturbance knocking about this sea. There's
trouble ahead&mdash;typhoon season, you know. Nothing but wind moves that
awful swell. Look at that!"</p>

<p>A hill of water rolled majestically onward, catching us under the
counter, and sending us along its great, smooth crest, then dropping us
again as we had hardly steering way under the short canvas.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know which way it's coming&mdash;lay our course to drift out
of it, or run, but who knows&mdash;who knows before it strikes? I wish you
would see to the gear forward. I don't want things to get loose. And
take charge. No, sir; don't let anything out of the way happen while
you're on deck."</p>

<p>I saw the old man was getting nervous. The low pressure and the
sultriness were telling on him. He knew what was coming well enough,
and fretted under it. It was hard waiting, even for an old seaman like
himself. Slade came on deck, and puffed carelessly at his pipe, gazing
about, and then going aft to chat with the ladies. He was always ready
to cheer them up. Nothing would happen&mdash;positively nothing. There
was no use of their getting nervous at the heavy swell. It had often
happened before&mdash;a heavy swell and no wind, 'way out here in the middle
of the Pacific. No telling where the storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> might be, but, of course it
wouldn't be near us&mdash;oh, no.</p>

<p>Oleson came aft to me.</p>

<p>"Shall I lock in the Chinks?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "Lock 'em up, put a padlock on both doors, and see
that they don't get loose again until this is over."</p>

<p>Oleson went to Komuri. The Jap listened to him, and then repeated the
order, passing the word like a seaman should, without comment. The
Chinks followed him into their quarters in the alleyways, and Oleson
locked the doors on the outside, putting extra padlocks on them. The
alleyways were upon the main deck, and shut off from the lazaret by a
bulkhead.</p>

<p>"If honorable mate will let me open those ports inside, Chinese men
will be able to breathe better&mdash;air very hot in there," said Komuri.</p>

<p>"All right, king; go ahead. And if she lists over and drowns them like
rats in a trap you'll be the man to loose them&mdash;see?" I warned him.</p>

<p>"I'll take care them, me," said Komuri. "If honorable ship, she turns
over, me, Komuri, will see to ports. Very hot inside there."</p>

<p>I turned away and watched the horizon. The haze was thickening, and the
squalls were beginning to come with more force than before. A sudden
spurt of wind sang hoarsely in the rigging, and a drift of spray flew
upward.</p>

<p>The men were still at work making things snug when I heard a murmuring,
a moaning, vast, filling the air, then dying away again. It was all
about us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> seemingly upon all sides. Then again I heard a harplike note
of great volume. The horizon disappeared in the southeast, and the
blue-steel bank of vapor shut off the sunlight. It grew dark and gloomy.</p>

<p>"She's coming along all right in a few minutes," said Slade, who came
near to me and passed on to his room. He came on deck in a couple of
minutes, with an oilskin coat buttoned fast about him, and he sweltered
in its heat. I still stood at the weather rigging.</p>

<p>"Go get your rain clothes on," he said, coming to relieve me.</p>

<p>"Nix! Let her go as it is&mdash;better wet with salt water than sweat," I
replied.</p>

<p>The skipper came forward. He suggested that the two passengers go
below, and Jack, the steward, with Komuri to assist him, managed to get
them below without protest, although it was something like ninety-six
or seven in that saloon.</p>

<p>A white streak spread upon the sea. The squall struck, snoring away
with a vigor that told of more coming. The spumedrift flew over us.
Then another, and another furious blast of wind bore down upon the
schooner, and she lay slowly over until her rail was submerged.</p>

<p>In five minutes the hurricane was roaring over us, and the <i>Tanner</i> lay
upon her beam ends while we struggled with the mizzen, and held the
wheel hard up to throw her off, the weight of the wind holding her down
with a giant hand.</p>

<p>Yelling and struggling, all hands now tried to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> that mizzen in. It
was a waste of time. I saw the skipper clinging to the boom and using
his knife upon the canvas, and did likewise. With a thundering roar the
sail split, torn to ribbons. We could not make ourselves heard in the
chaos of sound, but waved frantically our orders and helped as only
good seamen can.</p>

<p>But the <i>Tanner</i> refused to go off. She lay flat out with her
cross-trees in the lift of the sea, and she hung there. The
forestaysail burst with a crack that we heard aft, and vanished as if
it had been snow in a jet of steam. The bonneted foresail held with the
wind roaring over the top of it, spilling away, but still keeping full
enough to keep from slatting and bursting. It was the heaviest canvas
and brand new, and all the time squall after squall bore upon the
straining ship, roaring, screaming with the blast of a gun as the puffs
came and went.</p>

<p>That wind was like a wall of something solid. To move in it was
enough to tax the strength. It pressed one against what was to
leeward&mdash;pressed him, held him and bore upon him like a weight of
something solid. To let go meant to run the risk of being blown bodily
away into the sea.</p>

<p>We clung along the weather rail, and hung on with both hands, watching
the white smother fore and aft, but unable to look to windward for an
instant against the blast. The outfly and uproar was so tremendous that
all sounds were lost in it. I found myself near Slade and the old man,
all three clinging to the rail, and gasping for breath. The skipper's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
gray head shone bare in the blast, and the white foam flecked it, and
dripped from his beard, his ruddy cheeks glowing red in contrast. His
teeth were set, and he was just holding on.</p>

<p>For a long time we three hung there, and did nothing but try to survive
the fury of that hurricane. The forward part of the schooner was
blotted out, and I just remember that to leeward, where I could look,
the surge boiled and foamed clear up to the hatch coamings.</p>

<p>I thought of the women below, and knew they were safe for the time
being. Then I remembered the starboard alleyway, and the ports that
Komuri had left open to give the Chinks air. The alleyway was now
completely submerged; the ports far below the surface of the sea, the
Chinamen were caught there like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>The narrow space must even now be filling up, and I thought of the poor
coolies struggling against that door the carpenter had so securely
locked and fastened upon them. They could never break it open, for upon
it we had placed our safety against another uprising, and the double,
two-inch planks bolted crossways would stand more than the weight of
the crowd that would be able to surge against it. The alleyway could
fill entirely without any water getting below.</p>

<p>I grabbed Slade by the arm, and pointed at the lower deck.</p>

<p>"The Chinks&mdash;below&mdash;can't get out!" I roared against the hurricane.</p>

<p>Slade grinned a sickly grin and nodded. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> ducked his head
against the wind and bellowed back:</p>

<p>"Can't help it&mdash;can't go there&mdash;sure death!"</p>

<p>I fancied I could hear the outcries of the imprisoned men, but the
deep, bass undertone of the hurricane roared away overhead and swept
away the impression.</p>

<p>It was sickening to think of it. Fully twenty men were in that
alleyway, and the four eight-inch ports were letting in four streams of
sea water, for the Chinamen would not know enough to jam them full of
clothes or anything they could get hold of, being little better than
animals in point of intelligence.</p>

<p>If the schooner would only pay off she would right herself and let the
openings come above the sea level; but she hung there dead, beaten down
by a blast so terrific that it seemed like a solid wall of something
heavy tearing upon her and crushing her life out. It took the breath
away, and I found myself gasping, trying to get air to breathe, sucking
in the flying drift and spray, and choking, holding one hand over my
nose and mouth to keep from actually drowning in the smother.</p>

<p>It seemed as if we had already been hove down a full hour, and I was
tiring. The schooner held doggedly broadside in the trough of the
sea, which was now appalling in height, and was breaking solidly over
her high rail and upturned side. We could not last much longer in the
dangerous position, and I began to believe we were lost. Our hatches
were closed, and no water could get below unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> something gave way,
but it was certain something would go before long under that strain.</p>

<p>I looked hopelessly at the man at the wheel, who had passed a lashing
upon his waist, and was straddling the shaft, clinging to the spokes
with desperation. I wondered if he still held the wheel hard up, but
knew that in her present knocked-down state it would make little
difference, for she would not steer without some headsail to swing her
out and off that mighty sea.</p>

<p>I crawled along the rail, fighting my way hand over hand, passing the
skipper and gaining the edge of the poop. I yelled to Douglas, who was
the man straddling the wheel shaft, but he only shook his head and
ducked from the squalls.</p>

<p>While I bawled for him to tell me what helm she carried, I was aware
of a figure crawling from the companionway to the after cabin. It
came creeping up just under me, up the almost perpendicular deck, and
it looked like a big monkey until it came right into me, and then I
recognized Komuri, our little steward.</p>

<p>Komuri was yellow, a pasty yellow, and his wrinkled face looked old and
haggard. He was only partly dressed, and he clawed the rail frantically
for a hand hold. He looked the worst-scared Jap I had ever seen or
dreamed of. He climbed close to me.</p>

<p>"Men locked in&mdash;all die&mdash;ports open," he screeched in my ear.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;can't help it&mdash;door under water&mdash;no tools," I yelled in
reply, and he howled something that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> ended in a screech that was
unintelligible, for over it all sounded that deep, bass roar,
thundering, booming, vibrating into chaos all sounds.</p>

<p>I watched him, and he climbed past me, making his way forward with
amazing speed, considering he was crawling along a wall which had been
the deck. He made the break of the poop, and disappeared, going in the
direction of the forward house, although how he ever expected to get
there was beyond reason.</p>

<p>Something made me follow him, and soon Slade and myself were at the
edge of the poop, and gazing down at the partly submerged door of the
starboard alleyway. While we looked, Komuri came climbing along the
rail of the ship, disappearing now and then under the solid water that
swept her, but, to our amazement, still keeping hold of the pins, and
gaining slowly toward us.</p>

<p>In one hand he held Oleson's ax, and he was coming toward us, coming to
do a piece of work we had already given up as impossible.</p>

<p>No word was spoken as Komuri struggled up to where we clung and gasped
for breath, half drowned in the rush of water.</p>

<p>I passed the end of a line about him after a fashion, and he dropped
off to starboard down the steep slant, and instantly went under as a
huge sea fell over the schooner.</p>

<p>We held the line. Then we saw him again, and he was hacking away at the
door, chopping at the lock and staple while he swung scrambling with
his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> against the planks. Slade thoughtfully dropped down other
lines, and made them fast.</p>

<p>I could see little of what was going on. The seas were breaking over
us now with tremendous volume, and it seemed only a question of a few
minutes before the schooner must go down, anyhow, for she couldn't lie
on her beam ends very long without something giving way.</p>

<p>The work of getting at those Chinks appeared to me now a useless labor.
We would all be where there was no caste, no coolies, in a short time.
And yet such is the habit of a seaman, he works on against certain
failure at times, when ordinary folk would accept the verdict and quit.</p>

<p>I held Komuri until my arms were nearly paralyzed, and I was fainting
with exertion and lack of air. The first thing I knew of what he had
done was when a Chink came climbing monkey fashion up one of the lines,
followed by another and another, their yellow faces pasty and drawn,
and their pigtails streaming after them. They clung along the weather
side, and lashed themselves fast to whatever they could find. I saw the
dark figures of a couple fade away in the smother to leeward, and knew
they had gone to where all Chinks go sooner or later, but the rest came
up and clung for life there in the strident breath of the typhoon, and
the booming roar drowned out even their shrieks and yelps.</p>

<p>I tried to haul Komuri up again, but could not. I howled for Slade
to help me, but he was separated by a row of Chinks, and couldn't
reach me. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>I hammered the nearest Chinaman over the head in frantic
desperation to make him haul line and save the little Jap, but the
fellow only ducked the blows, which were too weak to hurt much.</p>

<p>Komuri, exhausted, could not climb back. He could no longer help
himself; and he was trusting to me to get him up from the white smother
beneath that was drowning him. The madness of my weakness came over
me. I had been a bucko mate with ready hand, and could take them by
and large as they came from the dock to the forecastle, but here I was
weakening, holding to a line at the end of which was the bravest little
man I had even seen, the gamest little fighter&mdash;Komuri, son of Samurai,
the fighting class of the Japanese.</p>

<p>And Komuri was going to his death because I couldn't help him. On and
on I struggled with the line, bellowing curses, but I could get little
or no line over the pin, and I was growing surely weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>Then I stopped, and tried to see if there was any chance to help, any
chance to save the little hero. I saw Komuri dangling in the foam, his
face upturned to me, and a smile upon his yellow, wrinkled visage. He
waved feebly to me, and I knew he was signaling for me to haul him
up&mdash;and was wondering why I didn't.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, you poor little devil!" I howled. "It's too bad&mdash;too bad!"</p>

<p>A gigantic sea crashed over the schooner, a mountain of water. I passed
the line about my waist, and snatched a turn to keep from being washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
away. That was the last I remembered for some time.</p>

<p>When I regained my senses I was lying on the deck, and Slade was
dragging me by the arm toward the cabin doors. The roar of the
hurricane still boomed over us&mdash;the wild rush of the sea&mdash;but it came
from aft now, and I knew they had at last got her off the wind, and
were running her either to hell or safety.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I was struggling up the companionway again to the
deck, where the old man was now conning her, and watching her run
seventeen knots an hour before a series of hurricane squalls that
simply lifted her almost bodily out of the sea.</p>

<p>I saw we had passed the center of the cyclone, for we had the wind
almost directly opposite from where it was when we lay knocked down. I
got to the shelter of the mizzen, and from there watched the men at the
wheel hold her as she ran. Some one had loosed a bit of canvas forward,
but it had blown away, and the ribbon streamers stretched and cracked
until they vanished in the blast.</p>

<p>"How'd you do it?" I yelled to Slade, who clung in the lee.</p>

<p>"Squalls let up sudden&mdash;hit the center&mdash;she righted, and then ran off
when we hit the other side of it!" howled the mate.</p>

<p>"Where's Komuri?" I howled.</p>

<p>"Don't know&mdash;must have gone to leeward. Some Chinks gone, too&mdash;you came
near going."</p>

<p>That was all I could get from Slade. But I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> all that was
necessary. Komuri had gone to the port of missing ships. He had died
as a Samurai should, facing his end fearlessly, fighting to the last
for others in the hope to save them, the ones he had tried to help by
giving them air and leaving their ports open when they should have
been closed. He had known his responsibility, and had done what we had
failed to do.</p>

<p>There were three Chinamen missing, but our own men were safe. They had
got under the side of the engine house, where they were protected from
both the sea and wind. They clung there until the vessel righted, and
then turned to with a will to save the ship.</p>

<p>We ran the <i>Tanner</i> all that day and the following night, keeping her
before a mighty sea that almost overran us. She steered well once she
got off before it, and after we got canvas on her forward she was safe
enough. It had been a close squeak for all hands, and we breathed
easier as she ran out of the disturbance and came again upon her
course. A week later we ran her in behind the reef of Guam, and came to
anchor off the town of Aga&ntilde;a, where we were to discharge part of our
cargo and the Chinese.</p>

<p>In behind the barrier we ran her without further incident, and as
the wind fell we rolled up the canvas and let her drift into fifteen
fathoms before letting go the hook.</p>

<p>The ladies came on deck for the first time since the typhoon, and gazed
happily at the beautiful island crowned with green, tropical foliage&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
welcome relief to the eye that had seen only the blue water for so
long. They were to leave us here, and we were to go on to Manila,
coming later to take them back upon the return voyage. It would give
them three months on Guam.</p>

<p>"Where is our little Jap, Kamuri&mdash;we haven't seen him for a week?"
asked Miss Aline. "He was nice about getting our things together&mdash;we
really must have him help us ashore."</p>

<p>"Hasn't Slade told you?" I said.</p>

<p>"No. What do you mean?" she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Komuri is dead&mdash;lost in the typhoon&mdash;he saved the Chinks," I answered.</p>

<p>Both women gasped their surprise.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry!" exclaimed the younger.</p>

<p>"And he was so good," said her aunt. "I wondered why Mr. Slade hadn't
spoken of him before. I suppose it's because Mr. Slade feels that he is
now to be your guardian and must protect you from all ill news&mdash;oh, I
forgot&mdash;you hadn't heard. Yes, Mr. Slade is the man. He saved Aline's
life, you know, and they are to be married after we get back. Strange
he didn't tell you."</p>

<p>I thought so, too. Slade was a sly dog&mdash;and he had used my collars,
also, in his wooing. I was&mdash;well, I was ready to congratulate any man
who could make up his mind to marry.</p>

<p>But I turned away so abruptly that I thought I had to apologize to
Slade afterward, to keep from getting in a row with him. But Slade
understood, and squeezed my hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>"There's some of that port left over below," he said, and he led the
way down.</p>

<p>He filled two glasses to the brim, handing me one.</p>

<p>"To your health&mdash;and that of Miss Aline," I said stiffly, feeling that
there was something to say, or do.</p>

<p>"No," said Slade slowly, thoughtfully, "to the best man."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;to me, the best man at the wedding?" I said, in feigned surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," corrected the mate. "Not at all&mdash;although you are not so bad,
old chap." He raised his eyes and looked straight into mine. "We drink
to the best man in the ship&mdash;who was in the ship&mdash;to Komuri."</p>

<p>And we drained our glasses.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AT THE END OF THE DRAG-ROPE</h2></div>


<p>There were five men all told in the fishing schooner <i>Flying Star</i>.
I had known them all well, and had been shipmate with four of them.
Captain Johnny Sparks was a Dutchman, a "squarehead," but a good
seaman, and he had fished on the Hatteras Banks during three bluefish
seasons. His vessel was a Provincetown specimen&mdash;what used to be termed
the "Gloucester fisherman" type, before the decadence of that port in
the industry which once made it famous had ended its shipbuilding.</p>

<p>She was a small vessel, much smaller than the modern Provincetown
fisherman, which has a short foremast, a mainmast planted almost
amidships, and sweeping canoe bows with overhang. No, she was of the
old type&mdash;two sticks stuck upright in her at almost equal distances,
marking her into three almost equal parts; a main-topmast sprung well
forward and stayed well aft to steady the "whip" of long and continuous
plunging into a lifting head sea. She was "chunky" in model, bows
rather bluff, almost like a coaster, and her stern was of the old-time
sawed-off pattern, sunk low in the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> an ugly stern for running in
a heavy sea when the lift is quick and fast.</p>

<p>She was not worth over two thousand dollars, but Captain Johnny owned
half of her, and he had no criticisms to make of her behavior in heavy
weather. With a long, straight keel and full under-body, she was an
excellent sea craft, provided she was properly handled.</p>

<p>I was mate of the passenger ship <i>Prince Alfred</i> with Bill Boldwin,
running from New York to the West Indies, and as we ran on schedule we
often fell in with the Hatteras fishermen twice during a voyage.</p>

<p>Johnny was fishing three miles north of the Diamond Shoal Lightship
as we passed him on our voyage out. He stood upon his quarterdeck
and waved to me. I was on the bridge, and bawled out I would have
some fruit for him on the return trip. He nodded and waved his hand
in appreciation, and his cook poked his head out of the galley and
grinned. His boats were scattered along the shoal, all hauling up
bluefish as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Four other vessels from New York were on the grounds, but I recognized
none of them. Our passengers gazed at the small boats tossing as only
light-built dories can toss in a lively sea; and they commented on the
fishing.</p>

<p>As a rule, the average landsman thinks all fishing is done on the Grand
or George's Banks. They get the idea from writers who know these waters
well, and it never enters their heads that the northern banks are but
a very small part of the great Atlantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> fishing grounds, where the
professional fisherman must toil to wrest his living from the salt sea.</p>

<p>It was due to a Gloucester Yankee, though, that the great fishing
of Campeche Bank became known. Hove-to in a vicious norther a few
score miles off Galveston, the "cod-hauler" was driven gradually
off shore until he was far away from the land. Suddenly from a
fathomless gulf&mdash;he had had the perseverance to keep his lead going
at intervals&mdash;he fetched the ground in thirty fathoms, and gradually
shoaled his water.</p>

<p>With a hook just above the lead, he soon began to haul up snappers, and
he came running into port a few days later with his schooner loaded to
her bearings with as prime fish as ever came out of the sea.</p>

<p>Captain Johnny had fished there a year, but owing to the slowness of
the <i>Flying Star</i> he had given it up until the steam patrol boat had
been put on to make the rounds and buy the fish on the grounds. It was
Johnny who had gone into Sabine once for water when Dick Hollister was
marshal.</p>

<p>Hollister was a saturnine chap, who wore a heavy Colt with seven
notches in the handle, each notch meant for some beggar he had been
forced to perforate in the course of his strenuous career. He was
accounted one of the most fearless and able marshals in Texas. One
morning he visited the <i>Flying Star</i>, apparently looking for a man he
wanted for a certain episode in horses. He swaggered about the decks
with his Colt in full view, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> caused so much interest that he
impeded the work.</p>

<p>Johnny spoke softly to him&mdash;he always had a soft way of speaking&mdash;and
told him he must get ashore. The marshal turned and gazed at the little
"squarehead" in disdain; but Captain Johnny, who was sitting on his
hatch-combing, looked up with gentle gray eyes and pointed to the jetty.</p>

<p>"You get avay&mdash;get oudt wid you, my friend. I don't got no time fer
wastin' wid circus-actor mens wid funny fringes and artillery dragging
mid dere waist belts&mdash;git!"</p>

<p>And as the marshal didn't move, Johnny shied a coiled line at him,
hitting him somewhat violently in the body.</p>

<p>Instantly Hollister drew his Colt.</p>

<p>"You blamed little shrimp! if you do that again I'll plug you," he said
quietly, wiping the fish scales and salt water from his clothes. "Don't
make any mistake; I'm not your friend."</p>

<p>Captain Johnny was especially blue and sad that morning, so he gazed at
the marshal, while his hand reached for a heavy sinker.</p>

<p>"If you ain't my friend, fire away not; if you are mine friend, you
shoot me, for I'm tired enough wid dis business, an' I don't vant do be
livin' always, forever, yet. Shoot, mein dear friend, shoot&mdash;or if not
mine friend, den take dis!"</p>

<p>And he tossed the pound lead with such precision that it stretched
Hollister flat upon the deck before he could take good aim to do more
than rip the collar off Johnny's coat with his fire. When he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> to,
Johnny was bathing his head where the sinker had cut him, and pouring
good whisky down his throat.</p>

<p>"You are mine friend&mdash;but a poor shot&mdash;take another drink with me, and
den go. Here's your blunderbust&mdash;you interrupts de vork on de deck&mdash;git
oudt!"</p>

<p>And yet there was a lot of energy in that sturdy form standing there
upon the deck of his undermanned schooner waving his acknowledgments to
me upon the bridge of the liner. Yes, Captain Johnny Sparks was a good
seaman. May the deep ocean hold him gently in its eternal embrace, for
he loved it&mdash;loved it as only a true seaman does!</p>

<p>We made the run south, and were coming up with a full complement of
passengers from Jamaica, when we began to notice a definite change in
the weather. It was the hurricane season, September, and the heat was
oppressive. The passengers lay about the decks in chairs all day and
half the night, getting what air the ship made with her rush of fifteen
knots an hour through the quiet sea. We ran along through the Passage,
leaving Cape Maysi out of sight before dark, and rapidly hauling up
under the lee of the Great Inagua Bank. Here in the smooth sea night
fell upon the ocean, and I went on the bridge for the first watch.</p>

<p>As I came into the pilot house to sign the order-book for my course,
Captain Boldwin called my attention to the glass. It had fallen rapidly
during the last few hours, and was now dangerously low.</p>

<p>"Keep a good lookout," he said, "and call me at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> first signs of a
change." I signed the order-book, and he went below.</p>

<p>How many times has an officer signed that order-book before even going
on the bridge? And how many times has the said officer made an entirely
different course from that signed for? But then steamship companies do
not supply ships and coal for their officers to study navigation. It
would not look well on paper. Every officer of a passenger ship is a
licensed master, a captain; and no first-class company will ship any
other kind of man to go on the bridge to take charge for the watch
of four hours, for during that time the ship is absolutely under his
command, and it is necessary that he shall be a skilled navigator,
capable of taking the ship along just as safely should accident befall
her commander. For this responsibility he receives from seventy-five
to a hundred dollars per month; and half of the passengers whose lives
he holds in the hollow of his hand for half the night look upon him as
little better than a ship's cook!</p>

<p>We appeared to follow the low barometer, or it to follow us, for when
daylight came we were still running smoothly across the Atlantic with
nothing but an oppressive heat and mugginess to warn the landsman of
the low pressure.</p>

<p>"There's something coming along behind us; something there astern that
will probably make things howl," said Boldwin, as he came on deck in
the morning.</p>

<p>The sun was brassy in a coppery haze, but it was clear enough to get
a good sight for longitude. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> called off three good sights, took the
note, and went below to work the longitude before breakfast. On ships
running across the Gulf or Florida Stream from the southward, bound for
New York or some port south of it, there is every necessity for getting
the westing accurate. We always found that, running diagonally across
for the Diamond Shoal Light vessel, we were set about twelve miles to
the northeast while running at from twelve to fifteen knots. This was
almost a regular fixed factor, but in heavy weather it was not always
safe to run full speed inside of it.</p>

<p>To make to the eastward of the lightship was well enough, but to fetch
to the westward was the one thing that has always made Boldwin nervous,
and rightly so. If he missed it going to the eastward, he would pick
up some other landfall to the northward, if he was too far off; but if
he missed it going to the westward in a driving gale, when it was too
thick to see half a mile&mdash;well, we had never done so yet, and had no
reason to pray for the experience.</p>

<p>We were a fast liner, full of fruit and passengers, and we could not
stop for anything on the run up. With fifty thousand bunches of bananas
below, we must drive the ship to her destination as fast as she could
go, and neither hurricane nor calm must stop her. The company seldom
kept a seaman long who brought in fifty thousand bunches of ruined
fruit, some of it twelve hands, and most of it more than eight, selling
at retail at nearly a dollar a bunch.</p>

<p>Two years before, Boldwin, after being hove-to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> for thirty-six hours
in a gale, had brought in his ship laden with fruit he had taken under
protest, the "yellow" being plainly in sight at the ends of more than
half the bunches. He had docked, and a score of men had waded about
for several days up to their hips in a mess which, once seen, causes
all lovers of bananas to eschew that fruit forever afterward. Banana
juice will cut the steel plates of a ship's side almost like diluted
sulphuric acid&mdash;but they gave him another chance.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the day we had run clear of the land,
when the first signs of the hurricane of September 19, 1903, made its
appearance. The swell began to roll heavily from the southeast with a
curious cross-roll from the westward, making a peculiarly uncomfortable
sea for a steamer running northward. It dropped away from under our
counter, and the <i>Prince Alfred</i> dipped her taffrail almost to the
unruffled surface. Then she would rise upon it, and, as it lifted well
under her underbody, she would roll to port and throw her stern so high
that the starboard screw would race in a storm of foam at the surface,
shaking her tremendously, and annoying the passengers who happened to
occupy after-staterooms.</p>

<p>When the second officer, Smith, came on duty, I made my way aft to take
a look over things&mdash;to see that the small boats were securely lashed;
that gratings and gear were in place, for it was evident that we were
to have a piece of dirty weather. A large, fat, pale-faced woman poked
her head out of window and demanded that I have the starboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> engine
stopped at once, as it was too racking on her nerves. She declared she
had stood it as long as she could, and would lodge a complaint with
the president of the company immediately she got ashore, if her demand
were not complied with instantly. I started to argue the case, but she
cut me short, exclaiming that "they never did such things on the French
boats."</p>

<p>All the gear was in order aft, and I had just made my way to the
bridge, when the Captain called my attention to a haze gathering to the
southward.</p>

<p>"The glass is starting down again&mdash;dropped two more tenths," he said.
"We'll run foul of something before eight bells. Looks like it was
following the Stream along to the northward; it usually does."</p>

<p>A heavy, blue-black bank of cloud, smooth, and swept into an immense
semicircle over the southern horizon, but rising fast, told of the
beginning of trouble. Half an hour later we began to feel the squalls,
which came suddenly and with vicious spurts of fine rain.</p>

<p>"According to old Captain Valdes," said Boldwin, "if you place your
back to the wind, the center of the blow is to the left, or port side,
and a bit behind you. This breeze is coming in from the east'ard good
and quick, and it looks like we'll fetch the center straight and fair
the way we're heading."</p>

<p>"Would you stop her and heave her up?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Stop her? Not as long as she'll swim. What do you think we are&mdash;a
sand-barge? Stop a liner running on schedule with a fortune of bananas
lying below? Get those ventilators trimmed, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> three covers on
the after hatch and lash them fast. We'll run her. Who do you think
would take this packet out the next voyage if he hove her to?"</p>

<p>As it was only too evident that it would be my chance, I said nothing.</p>

<p>The light grew dim as the gray pall of the storm quickly overspread the
sky. The dull gray light made the sea appear queer and dark, with the
great heave now running quickly, as though a mighty power were working
close behind it. The tops of the breaking combers had a peculiar lift
to them as they met the cross-swell, and the racing of the starboard
engine became more and more violent. A terrific squall bore upon the
ship, seemed to almost lift her bodily before it. The roar of the wind
whirling through the heavy standing rigging told of its velocity, and
then we waded right into the thick of it, with the <i>Prince Alfred</i>
lurching along eighteen knots an hour over a sea which was torn into a
white and gray world that ended, so far as our vision was concerned, a
few fathoms from the ship's side.</p>

<p>Boldwin was standing on the bridge, holding to the rail, and leaning to
the blasts as though it took his whole weight to bear up against them.
I came close to him.</p>

<p>"Get every one ... below! Lock in ... passengers!" I caught his words
with my ear ten inches from his mouth. "Cover ... hatches ... all fast."</p>

<p>I knew what he meant. When the <i>Prince Alfred</i> closed down her cargo
there was something unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> happening. Making my way down the bridge
steps, I got the men of the watch together. It was tough work, for the
sea was now ugly, and we were running our weather-rail down at each
roll, and scooping up plenty of water which she sent across her decks
to leeward. To stand up without holding on meant to be blown bodily
against the lee rail at the risk of going over.</p>

<p>It was an hour before I got back to the bridge, and when I did so, the
squalls were becoming more frequent, and more and more violent, but
there was no shift yet. It soon grew dark&mdash;a black dark&mdash;and we tore
along into the blackness, unable to see two fathoms ahead. As yet we
were outside the Stream, and consequently not in the usual line of the
coasters, which are the dread of the liner's officers, for nothing
is so uncomfortable as the sudden raising of the dim and sometimes
half-extinguished lights of a schooner on a thick night while tearing
along before a gale. Having the right of way, the sailing vessel has
nothing to do but keep her course, while the steamship, with but a
few seconds to spare, swings quickly to pass, sometimes missing a
catastrophe by a few feet. A poor red light on such a night cannot be
seen twenty fathoms.</p>

<p>Before midnight the shift began. It came from the southward&mdash;a bad
sign, for it told plainly that we were nearing the center of the
disturbance; and as we were heading diagonally across the path of the
storm, we were almost certain to bring up in its dread vortex. As chief
officer, it would have been a bit out of place for me to suggest the
thing the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>ordinary seaman would do&mdash;that is, heave to and work out of
it. Boldwin stood on his bridge and kept her going.</p>

<p>And yet it had to come. Before daylight the sea was terrific&mdash;the
squalls coming with furious rushes, shifting, and hurling a frightful
sea. A huge, lifting hill of water broke high above the taffrail, and
roared a full fathom deep over the quarter-deck. The crash shook the
steamer through her whole frame. It was as though she had struck a
solid rock. The white glint of the foam showed through the blackness,
but the dull, thunderous roar drowned all other sounds.</p>

<p>Boldwin went to the speaking tube in the pilot house, called to the
chief engineer to stand by to heave her to and watch the engines as she
came into the trough.</p>

<p>"We'll have to stop her," he said; and I nodded assent.</p>

<p>In the pilot house the clanking of the steam steering gear sounded
dully in the deep, sonorous undertone of the gale outside.</p>

<p>Boldwin waited but a moment, and then gave the order:</p>

<p>"Hard over, sir!" cried the quartermaster; and the rattling clank
of the engine sounded the signal for me to take advantage of the
opportunity to get outside by the lee door.</p>

<p>If it had been blowing before while we were running, it was now a blast.</p>

<p>The <i>Prince Alfred</i> laid down her whole five hundred feet of steel side
into that sea, and the crash of the mighty hill that swept her shook
her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> as though she had been struck amidships by the ram of a battleship.
The forward funnel guys parted, and I had a momentary glimpse of a
great pillar of iron going over the side to leeward. Then she began to
head the sea, and no human could face the storm of flying water which
swept the bridge.</p>

<p>With heads down, gasping for breath, Boldwin and myself gripped the
bridge rail. The flying atmosphere tore past us. We dared not loose our
grasp for an instant, and to get back to the shelter of the pilot house
was impossible without following the iron rail aft.</p>

<p>After a thunderous rush of quick and vicious squalls, there was a
sudden lull. A giant comber showed ahead, and its white and foaming
crest lifted clear into the night. She buried her whole forward deck,
and, as the water cleared, we could see about us. The dull snore of a
giant sea sounded close aboard. It was uncanny, this sudden stillness,
full of a palpitating murmur and pregnant with an ominous power.</p>

<p>"Right in it!" gasped Boldwin. "How does she head now?"</p>

<p>"Southeast by south," I answered. "The next squall will probably come
from the northwest."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we'll swing her while it's still&mdash;Lord, what an awful
sea!"</p>

<p>The <i>Prince Alfred</i> came slowly around with her engines turning at
half speed. The high, leaping hills of water seemed to come from all
directions at once. They fell upon her decks and shook her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> up a
bit, but did no damage. Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed. A distant
murmuring sounded over the torn sea.</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked Boldwin nervously.</p>

<p>A puff of cool air blew straight in our faces; we had not noted how
sultry it was, for we were soaking wet and exhausted. The puff blew to
a breeze. Then came a spurt of rain and a faint flash of lightning. In
a minute we were facing furious squalls, and the <i>Prince Alfred</i>, with
a full head of steam, had all she could do to keep steering way with
her nose pointed straight into the blast from nor'-nor'-west.</p>

<p>It was in the gray of the early morning, while Boldwin and I were still
on the bridge, and the second and third officers were in charge of the
saloons quelling the panic, that we sighted something dead ahead. The
squalls were still whirling over us with longer intervals between, but
with still undiminished vigor. The great sea began to show in front now
through the dim light, and it was all the full-powered liner could do
to hold her own head to it. To swerve to either side meant falling off
into the dangerous trough, with the hazard of not being able to regain
her course. Even as it was, we had to more than once slow the port or
starboard engine to enable her to point her nose straight into the
hurricane.</p>

<p>Upon the crest of a giant hill of water something showed black. It was
a momentary glimpse, but Boldwin and I saw it instantly. It was close
aboard and, as we yelled to each other and strained our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> eyes ahead,
we made out the thin line of a mast. Boldwin dropped on his hands and
knees and was blown to the pilot-house door. I waved my hand to ease
her to starboard a little. Just then a sea struck us heavily upon the
starboard bow, and held her with its rush. The next moment the shape
ahead was high upon the crest of a mighty sea, and I recognized the
stern of a vessel outlined against the gray pall.</p>

<p>I looked over the side. The foam was lying dead with us, showing we
were not going ahead more than a knot or two. Boldwin saw it also, and
knew that to slew his ship now would mean to get struck a blow in the
side which in that sea would probably prove fatal. He thought of his
passengers. They must be considered first. Whatever was ahead was going
to hit us, and it was due to those we had aboard that it must strike
us as fairly upon the stem as we could land it. God help them, we must
save our own!</p>

<p>We plunged headlong into the trough, and right above us upon the
following crest rose the stern of that sailing vessel. She was plainly
in view now; so close that I recognized the sawed-off shape of an
old-time fishing schooner. Upon her main a bit of rag like a trysail
showed white. She was heading the sea at the end of her sea anchor, a
long drag-rope, and as her deck showed, I saw she had been badly swept.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight. She was going astern fast, much faster than
we thought, for even while Boldwin tried to edge to starboard, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
all he could to swing his ship without getting his head thrown off with
the sea, the stern sank just ahead of us in the hollow of a sea, and
our stem rose above. I leaned forward and held my breath. The <i>Prince
Alfred</i> fell headlong into the hollow, and just as we struck I read the
name <i>Flying Star</i> painted large and white right across the transom.</p>

<p>A dull grinding thud, which shook the <i>Prince Alfred</i> but slightly, was
all that came to us. A sea swung the wreck to port, and as she heeled
and settled, I saw Johnny Sparks spring from the companionway, followed
by several men. The next instant a great comber roared over them and
the schooner disappeared, leaving nothing above the foam to show where
she had floated a moment before. Something caught in my throat. I shut
my eyes, and held my head down for I don't know how long.</p>

<p>We came into port four days later with Boldwin on the bridge, his face
lined and haggard. Below, thirty thousand dollars' worth of bananas
slushed about in a ghastly mess, in spite of the pens and shorings. But
the passengers were happy. Women in gay dresses came on deck and smiled
and chatted, and children romped and played. The captain did not look
at me&mdash;he had not since the collision&mdash;but he spoke to me for the first
time.</p>

<p>"See that everything is shipshape when we dock," said he, "and then
meet me at the company's office at four o'clock. I'll probably not take
her out next voyage&mdash;take a lay-off for a while&mdash;understand?"</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PIRATES TWAIN</h2></div>


<p>At last I was back in the regular liners of the Prince ships. My work
on the <i>Heraldine</i> had been appreciated by Lord Hawkes, the manager,
and his lordship was no piker.</p>

<p>He refused Boldwin my company when that worthy but thirsty skipper
asked to have me back in the old <i>Prince Alfred</i>, where a certain lady
whom I admired greatly was stewardess.</p>

<p>The new <i>Prince George</i>, twenty-five thousand tons and a
twenty-two-knot vessel, was wanting a first officer, and old man Hall
was somewhat disposed to give me "a chance," as the saying is at sea
when an officer applies for a berth.</p>

<p>"You may report to the captain to-morrow at the dock," said his
lordship, and our interview was at an end. Boldwin looked sour, for I
had been a good mate to him, and he wanted me badly, but the manager's
word was law.</p>

<p>I found the giant liner all that modern improvements could make her.
From her six-hundred-foot keel to her four immense funnel tops, she was
a beauty.</p>

<p>It would take a week to describe her many qualities, and I must admit
it gave me a feeling of responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> when I stepped upon her flying
bridge and looked her over.</p>

<p>There I would be in command every four hours, and when I gazed over her
immense length and breadth it seemed indeed that I must be a person of
some small ability to hold the job.</p>

<p>No flippant remarks here, no joking about the passengers or the
company. It was silence and dignity.</p>

<p>How I stood it at first is more of a wonder to me, when I look back
at the time, than the actual work, for really a ship's officer is not
considered a mighty position, even though he does hold the lives of a
couple of thousand folks in his keeping during his watch on deck.</p>

<p>But I was not too old, and had ambition, for some day I wanted to have
a little farm of my own and raise chickens and hogs&mdash;the true ambition
of every seaman I ever met&mdash;and I wanted to ask a certain lady to run
the said farm for me, or rather do the cooking, which is probably the
same thing.</p>

<p>Our crew was shipped by the agents. Old man Hall had nothing whatever
to do but act as overseer of the navigators, which same were myself and
a second officer named MacFarland.</p>

<p>Mac was a good seaman, although he had never been in sail, but had
risen from the apprentice school of officers established by the company
to train men for its ships&mdash;and they were of course all steam.</p>

<p>I must admit he knew more of express ships than I, but I had ten years
more sea duty done, and I was something of a windjammer in my time.
This gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> me the rating with the older men who had served the same way
in the old sailing vessels.</p>

<p>We knew each other, and could depend always upon certain things in each
other that no school could develop the same way. I sat at the head of
the chief officers' table, and I bought a book of table etiquette to
get the lay of the whack just right.</p>

<p>It taught me many things I hadn't learned in a ship's forecastle, and
soon I was able to speak to the prosperous-looking passengers without
feeling that my tongue was in the way of my teeth.</p>

<p>We carried three hundred first-class&mdash;that was some when you think
of it&mdash;and we often herded fifteen hundred to two thousand in the
steerage. Four hundred seconds added sometimes put our total complement
over three thousand souls, counting, of course, our crew, stokers, and
waiters.</p>

<p>You will realize at once the inability of a chief mate getting even the
slightest acquaintance with hundreds of the people who used the <i>Prince
George</i> for transportation across the ocean, and, if I could not get
a line on them, it was equally impossible for the pursers, pursers'
clerks, and stewards to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuels, the head purser, had a memory that was said to be
infallible. He said he never forgot a face. Of the million or two
people he came in contact with during his runs, he boasted that he
could always tell if he had ever seen one of them before.</p>

<p>I didn't believe it, of course; but, then, pursers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> have a way that
many seamen can't understand, anyhow.</p>

<p>Being an express ship, and carrying the first-class mail, we also had
an express safe. This was built into the body of the vessel, and was
like the new bank safes, with solid steel doors and time locks.</p>

<p>Two watchmen took charge, alternating night and day, and the massive
doors were not to be opened by any one alone. In that safe we often
carried three or four million dollars in solid gold bars or gold coin.</p>

<p>Sometimes the banking houses of the United States shipped as much as
two million at a time in coin. Precautions were of the modern banking
sort, and the giant safe caused no comment.</p>

<p>The other safes of the purser and captain were just plain, every-day
affairs, and seldom held more than a few thousand dollars. These were
very different from the "through" safe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had been in the ship four months before I noticed a man who sat at
my table. He had made a voyage with us the first run I made, and I
remembered him as a clergyman who had relatives abroad in Europe, but
who was himself an American.</p>

<p>He was a very dignified man, about fifty-five years of age, and he
knew a great deal. I enjoyed talking to him, for he told me of many
places and events that were most interesting. But he never at any time
discussed religion, or even spoke of subjects relating to it.</p>

<p>Once on his second trip over, he came to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> room, and presented me
with a box of fine Havana cigars and, although it was against custom, I
asked him in, and he came.</p>

<p>We smoked while I should have been sleeping, but I was not by any means
overworked, and I rather enjoyed his society, flattered of course that
a man of such vast experience and learning should single out the chief
officer for a companion.</p>

<p>But then I knew many folks looked upon a master navigator as a likely
person to know, and was not very much surprised, setting it down to his
good taste and discernment&mdash;for I had gone a mile or two myself in my
day, and had seen a few things both ashore and afloat.</p>

<p>Once I remember he talked of finance and the great gold shipments that
were disturbing the country. He had followed the administration in its
effort to curb a panic that was threatened, and spoke of the money we
carried in gold coin that was for the purpose of staying a run at that
time upon a banking house that had many foreign affiliations.</p>

<p>"The express safe is generally full, is it not, during times like
these?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, we carry millions every voyage now," I answered, and noticed that
the Reverend Mr. Jackson made a peculiar grimace as if amused at the
news.</p>

<p>The conversation immediately drifted off to Cape Town, where the
minister had lately spent much time, and he soon left me to my slumber
and cigars.</p>

<p>I noticed that he had remarkable hands, immensely strong, as though he
had done much hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> work, and afterward I wondered at a small tattoo
mark on his wrist just beneath the edge of his cuff. He had powerful,
hairy wrists, and the blue mark showed very indistinctly through the
black hair, but it caused me to think of him as a strange man.</p>

<p>I asked him about it the next day when at the table, but he made an
evasive answer, smiling at my compliment to his strong physique.</p>

<p>"I was something of an athlete in my younger days," he finally
admitted, "and you must not think that because of my profession I live
a sedentary life. I work very hard among my parishioners, and play golf
a great deal. Of course, you, as a seaman, would hardly appreciate the
mysteries of this manly game."</p>

<p>"I confess that it seems rather tame," I admitted; "seems like a poor
sort of 'shinny' we used to play in America when I was a lad."</p>

<p>"My wife plays it also, and she is very strong and agile from the
exercise," said Mr. Jackson; "I hope you will meet her next month when
I return, as she will probably go to London with me."</p>

<p>I expressed pleasure at the thought, and noticed that Doctor Jackson
was really quite a good-looking man, and there was no reason in the
world why he should not possess a very pretty wife.</p>

<p>His clean-shaven face, lined, it is true, as though he had spent much
time at physical exertion of the heavier sort, was handsome enough. A
large, high nose, not badly shaped, set in between two steel-blue eyes,
wide apart, and his mouth, although thin-lipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> and hard-looking, was
not ugly, and his teeth were large, even, and snow-white.</p>

<p>Altogether he was a man of strength and character from his appearance,
and I remembered him for his kindness&mdash;and cigars.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, upon the return voyage, he came aboard and told me
he would bring his wife aboard the next morning, and was just then
seeing to his room, which was amidships, and upon the lower or main
deck, just above the express room and over the steel safe.</p>

<p>He asked me if I thought the noise from below would disturb them, his
wife being a nervous woman and irritable. I knew no sounds of any
consequence would penetrate the deck, which was steel, and assured him
that the voyage would be most pleasant, as the time of year was fine
upon the western ocean.</p>

<p>The next day I was too busy to notice the couple, but when we were at
sea and had made our departure, allowing me to go below to dinner, I
found that Doctor Jackson and his wife were seated at my table about
midway down the row of seats.</p>

<p>The minister nodded to me, and his wife smiled pleasantly. Her back
was to the ports, and the light was bad, but I saw that she was about
thirty, and very masculine in her appearance.</p>

<p>She had a very good complexion, rosy and healthy, but her face had a
peculiar hardness, a settling about the corners of the mouth that boded
ill for any one who crossed her temper. I made up my mind to feel sorry
for the doctor. Her voice <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>I could hear very indistinctly, but it had a
sort of hardness, a suppressed tone of assumed smoothness which I did
not like.</p>

<p>At eight bells that night when the day's work allowed me to get my time
below, I met them as I left the bridge. The doctor introduced me to
the lady, who stood tall and commanding in the darkness. She murmured
something indefinite, but acknowledged me without offering her hand.</p>

<p>I believed this coldness was more cultivated than natural, but, as I
had learned since being in express ships that ladies did, or did not
shake hands, according to their training, I passed it up for what it
was worth.</p>

<p>Doctor Jackson seemed a bit annoyed at the strained feeling, but I saw
no reason why a woman, a wife of a minister, should find much in common
with a seaman, even if he did happen to be the chief mate of the liner.</p>

<p>Our ways would naturally be different. Her topics of conversation would
not fit in with mine, and I was mortally afraid of offending her by
some sailor's slip in my tongue.</p>

<p>I really was glad when they left me to go to my room, and I hoped that
I would not have to entertain them any more than the rules of the
liner's etiquette called for.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day the doctor informed me that his wife had succumbed to the
rigors of the sea and the motion had made her deathly ill. I saw her no
more, and it was the fifth day out when the steward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> came to my room at
night and asked to speak to me privately.</p>

<p>"The couple in Room Sixty-two will not allow their bed to be made up
nor any one to enter. Doctor Jackson said to see you and it would be
all right; but you know, sir, it's against the rules not to allow
inspection. If you will attend to the matter, it will take the weight
off the old man&mdash;he tried to enter, but he was told he could not, owing
to the lady's indisposition."</p>

<p>"Aw, they're all right," I said. "Tell the captain I know the old
sky-pilot well, and that he's a minister who has been across twice
before with us. I'll go down there myself to-morrow and inspect. Give
the doctor my compliments and tell him I'm sorry the rules make the
inspection necessary."</p>

<p>"There's a strong smell of whisky, alcohol, sir, all the time, coming
from the room&mdash;don't know what it can be, but I'm afraid of fire. It's
probably some of those patent traveling stoves they use for heating
certain medicines or something."</p>

<p>"Well, cut it out&mdash;I'll go down in the morning&mdash;that's all," I said,
and then I turned in and forgot all about the incident.</p>

<p>The next day when I went below, I found the doctor and his wife waiting
for me. The lady had her face wrapped up in towels, and the doctor was
reading, sitting near the bed, which was a brass one, bolted to the
deck.</p>

<p>I excused myself, and was just on the point of leaving when I noticed
the smell of alcohol. It was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>mixed with one similar to the heated odor
of a red-hot stovepipe, burning metal.</p>

<p>"Have any trouble with the lights?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, everything is all right&mdash;one of the electrics broke and made a
little smell&mdash;no, all is as comfortable as one could wish, thank you,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll go the route all the way up?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, we'll transship at Queenstown&mdash;there's a yacht waiting for me
there, and we'll take her for the rest of the way to the African coast,
by way of Gibraltar. You might help us with our luggage to-morrow&mdash;our
little trunk is very heavy, you see." And he tried to raise one end of
a small steamer trunk that was allowed in the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be all right&mdash;the steward will fix you up&mdash;I'll see you
before you go," I said, turning away.</p>

<p>"I hope so," returned the doctor, with a most peculiar intonation in
his voice that made me look at him. But he was now turning the leaves
of the book again, and a moan from the bed made me hesitate no longer.</p>

<p>I left them, and sent word to the head steward to see to my friends
getting ashore in the morning.</p>

<p>As we entered the Channel, the passengers who were to go ashore came on
deck. Doctor Jackson and his wife appeared at the gangway, and waited
quietly for the boat.</p>

<p>The lady was now wrapped up in shawls, and her face was heavily veiled.
The clergyman himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> seemed a bit nervous, but they finally went over
the side with their luggage all right.</p>

<p>What he had told about that steamer trunk was no joke. Two assistant
stewards could hardly lift it.</p>

<p>Bound with iron and stoutly strapped, it seemed as though it would
burst of its own weight before it was placed in the lugger that
would take it ashore or rather to the small schooner that lay a few
miles distant and which the doctor had pointed out as the vessel he
had chartered as a yacht to take them on their summer cruise to the
beautiful Mediterranean.</p>

<p>I waved my hand, and then went below to turn in, for the last night is
always a bad one for the chief mate when making the land.</p>

<p>"Bang, bang, bang," came blows upon my door, followed by a yell from
without. I expected to find the ship in collision, and leaped from my
bunk half asleep. The express messenger stood without, accompanied by
four assistants and the steward, the purser, and the second officer.</p>

<p>"Safe blown, sir!" yelled the messenger. "It's bloomin' well half
empty, sir! Nearly a quarter of a million gone. Party from above&mdash;you
knew them, the steward says!"</p>

<p>I ran with them to Room Sixty-two, and burst in where the captain stood
gazing at a hole in the deck. He turned to me, but said nothing. The
rug which had been placed over the opening was thrown aside, and there
lay a hole eighteen inches wide right in the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>Upon the sides the charred wood told of some fierce heat to which it
had been exposed. The heavy steel plate beneath had been melted and
burned as if the blast of a volcano had seared it.</p>

<p>Ragged-edged, melted, and bent lay the plate, and beneath it again
lay the hole in the express safe right in the treasure room beneath.
Down and through all led the seared hole. Some mighty heat had melted,
burned, and blown away the plates of hard steel.</p>

<p>I leaned over, and gazed down into the room where the gold had been
packed in the short, stout boxes of the bank. It was scattered about,
thrown all around in confusion as though the robbers had at last given
up all hope of getting more out.</p>

<p>They had taken all that two men could lift or carry for a few rods,
stopping only at the limit of their endurance; and, though the amount
was not so large as the express messenger had at first stated, it ran
well over one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a moment I stood staring from the hole to Captain Hall and back,
too amazed to speak, while the old man looked at me keenly.</p>

<p>"Nice little job," he commented dryly.</p>

<p>"The doctor and his wife&mdash;do you think?" I asked. I was beginning to
see light.</p>

<p>"Wife, thunder! That was a young man of tremendous strength," snarled
the express messenger. "Look how he used that electric burner&mdash;look how
he bent and tore at the plate&mdash;he was a giant&mdash;had the current on his
hot chisel all day&mdash;that's the smell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> you noticed. Probably the two
most expert safe-crackers alive, and our outfit gave them the chance
to work the hot knife, burn their way in where they never could have
blown. They connected with the light&mdash;got current enough to work with,
and covered up with the rug&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we won't waste time seeing how it was done; we'll get a move
after them", said the old man. "Jump on deck, and blow the siren&mdash;blow
the alarm for fire, police&mdash;set the signals&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was gone before he had finished, and by the time the uproar was well
under way I had time to gaze toward the little schooner the doctor had
marked out as his yacht.</p>

<p>She was still lying at anchor, but beyond her and about five miles
distant lay a fishing schooner with very tall spars and a very able
look. She was hoisting her foresail, and I could just make out that she
was getting under way at once.</p>

<p>I waited no longer. Jumping to the upper deck, I yelled for the crew
of the first cutter, boat number one, and gave the signal for her men.
They came scrambling as to the drill, and as they came I yelled to
young Smith, the third officer, to get arms and join me.</p>

<p>He dashed into his room, and came back with a heavy revolver. The
express messenger came up while we were lowering away, and handed me
another.</p>

<p>"We'll go with you," he said.</p>

<p>"No! No use loading her down with men," I replied; "we want to get some
speed on her&mdash;row six oars <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>double banked, and that'll fill her up&mdash;you
can come, you, Smith, and myself&mdash;it won't take a ship's crew to get
them&mdash;lower away," I called, and the boat dropped.</p>

<p>We followed, and in less time than it takes to tell it we were going
through the sea at seven knots an hour with the best-drilled boat in
the ship. Three men aft armed, and that was all.</p>

<p>It was a bright summer morning, with almost no wind, and I was certain
that we would soon overhaul the runaways. The schooner lifted her
anchor, and stood out to the westward and southward, and soon appeared
to be making good headway.</p>

<p>"By Jupiter, she's got a motor in her!" said Smith.</p>

<p>She was going ahead, almost straight in the eye of the wind, just close
enough to keep her sails full, and she was moving a good five knots.
She was a good four miles distant, and we would have to do some fine
rowing to catch her.</p>

<p>I looked my men over, and wondered if they could stand it. They pulled
steadily, and the boat went along swiftly, but even a heavy ship with
an engine has a distinct advantage over oars.</p>

<p>The schooner's motor was but an auxiliary, to be sure, but five or six
knots under motor was something desperate to catch by rowing when we
were so far astern.</p>

<p>At the end of another mile I was getting anxious. Our bearings were not
changed to any extent, and the third officer looked askance at me.</p>

<p>"Give it to her, bullies&mdash;there's a hundred apiece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> if we get them," I
said, and swung my body with the stroke of the oars. This had an effect
upon the men. A hundred dollars was more than three months' pay.</p>

<p>They put their weight upon the ash, and the boat fairly lifted under
the strain. The sweat began to pour down their faces, and the wind died
away, until the swell ran oily and smooth.</p>

<p>"Give it to her," I cried again, as we gained a little.</p>

<p>The two men at the bow oar swung mightily upon it. There was a sharp
crack. The bow oar snapped off at the rowlock, and the boat eased up
her speed, leaving two good men idle.</p>

<p>"Great snakes!" howled Smith, and the express messenger looked at me in
despair.</p>

<p>"We can't catch her now," he muttered.</p>

<p>I knew it was true. We were now dropping back, and I kept on only
because I felt that it would not do to give up. I scanned the sea for
signs of a boat.</p>

<p>There were some fishing to the northward, and it was our only chance. I
swung her around toward them.</p>

<p>"We've got to try for one&mdash;maybe there's one with a good motor in her,"
I said. In a quarter of an hour we were up to one boat, and saw she was
not fit. We swept past without slowing up.</p>

<p>"Any boat about here with a strong motor?" I asked, as we came close.</p>

<p>A fisherman waved his hand to the northward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>"Boat up there&mdash;<i>Seawave</i>&mdash;she's fast; what's the matter?" he replied.</p>

<p>But we were gone without further words, and soon came to the boat. She
was long and narrow, built like a seiner, only not so heavy. Two men
sat in her with lines out I hailed them as we came up.</p>

<p>"Want to catch that schooner out there," I yelled, pointing to the
vessel. "Give you a hundred dollars if you land us alongside&mdash;quick."</p>

<p>"Got the money?" asked the man who appeared to own her.</p>

<p>We came alongside without delay, and I felt rather foolish for a
moment. But the express messenger had the cash with him. He handed it
over without a word, and the fisherman turned quickly to his engine.</p>

<p>The other man pulled up the anchor at once, and in half a minute we
were under way, with the motor roaring out its glad sound in a series
of rapid shots that were like the discharges of a rapid-fire gun.</p>

<p>"Take the boat and follow," I called to the men, and then Smith, the
messenger, and myself were away in the wake of the schooner that was
now a good five miles off and going steadily seaward. It would be a
chase for fair.</p>

<p>"Can you make it?" I asked the owner, who sat in his oilskins at the
engine.</p>

<p>"Sure t'ing we make 'em&mdash;'bout two, three hours, if the gas holds out."</p>

<p>We were now going along at eight knots and running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> steadily. After
all, there's nothing like machinery to get things done.</p>

<p>"This is something like," said Smith. "There'll be some shooting inside
of an hour if the signs hold."</p>

<p>The messenger said nothing. The men of the boat had not asked a
question. They had taken us at our word, and were doing what they could
to put us alongside.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be different when we came to close quarters. We had
better tell them what our errand was before they stopped the motor
at the beginning of hostilities. They might take us for what we were
after&mdash;burglars, and spoil our chance to make a catch.</p>

<p>We drew near the schooner after two hours' chase. The land was lost
astern, and we had run fully fifteen miles off shore.</p>

<p>The breeze began to freshen, but not enough to give the schooner her
full, or even half, speed. She plugged along steadily at about five
knots, and we drew up close enough to see a man at the wheel and no one
else on deck.</p>

<p>Smith and the messenger told our skipper how matters stood, and the
fisherman seemed to hardly relish the game after he knew it. There was
certain to be trouble.</p>

<p>"Schooner ahoy!" I yelled, as we drew near enough to hail.</p>

<p>The man at the wheel paid no attention until I had repeated it several
times. Then he turned and asked us what we wished in no pleasant tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296</a></span>"You stop your engine and let us board," I yelled. "You have two
robbers aboard, and we want them in the name of the law."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the man, spitting over the rail. "Go away&mdash;I don't
know you."</p>

<p>"Run alongside&mdash;we'll jump her," I said to the skipper. The messenger,
Smith, and myself drew our revolvers, and stood ready as the small
craft came up to the main channels. The schooner kept right along. We
sprang aboard without meeting resistance, and gained the deck.</p>

<p>"Where're your passengers? Don't fool with us," I snapped. "There's an
old man and a young one dressed as a woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, Doctor Jackson and the young feller&mdash;they're down below&mdash;asleep.
What do you want with them?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We wasted no time talking. All three jumped down the companionway and
into the little cabin. Doctor Jackson was in a bunk, apparently fast
asleep, and a young man, whom I instantly recognized as the "wife," lay
reclining upon a transom.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the row&mdash;what's up?" asked the young fellow, rising at
the sight of three armed men.</p>

<p>"We want you&mdash;you know what for," said the messenger quietly. "Don't
make any trouble&mdash;we won't stand it&mdash;come right along back with us, you
and the other fellow there."</p>

<p>The doctor awoke, and sat up, seemingly amazed. He expostulated, was
dumfounded at the charge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> couldn't understand it&mdash;we must all be
crazy. Two men came from forward and joined our group. It was all
hands, just three men and two passengers&mdash;five in all to work the ship.</p>

<p>"Stop the engine," I ordered, "and either come with us or turn the
schooner back, and we'll go with you."</p>

<p>They turned her around, and stood back toward the shore. On the way,
while one of us stood guard over the two, the rest searched the
schooner for the treasure, for the trunk. There was not a sign of gold
anywhere aboard her.</p>

<p>We took turns, but found nothing, leaving not a bolt hole unsearched.
It was disheartening, and looked like we had lost, after all.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" I asked the messenger.</p>

<p>"Looks like they got us right, after all," he said; "we haven't the
slightest clew to the money, and won't get it after they once get in to
the police. They'll buy their way out, for there's not the slightest
evidence they did the job, although I know it was them as well as they
themselves."</p>

<p>"Plant it, you think?"</p>

<p>"Sure as death, they dropped it somewhere, and they only know just
where. They'll take a chance at going up for a spell, doing their bit,
and then getting the cache. It's on the course out somewhere, but just
where who knows? We're out of sight of land now, and it'll take a
wizard to locate it on the schooner's course."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>"That's right enough," I asserted, "but how about trying them for a
confession?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he replied gloomily.</p>

<p>I put it right up to the doctor. I promised him complete immunity if he
would just tell where they had dropped that four hundred and odd pounds
of gold.</p>

<p>The pair simply grinned in amusement. It seemed to tickle them
immensely.</p>

<p>"And so you'd be a party to a felony?" asked the doctor, with great
regret in his tone. "I didn't think that of you, captain&mdash;you surely
disappoint me greatly. Now, if I knew where the gold lay, I should
tell you at once, but warn you not to touch it, for I don't believe in
mixing up with things of this sort. The men you are after must surely
have taken the stuff on the previous voyage&mdash;or some other time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," I interrupted, "if you want it that way, you'll get it. We
have enough evidence to send you up for twenty years at least&mdash;direct
evidence."</p>

<p>"I hate to hear you take on in this terrible manner, my dear captain,
but I don't see what I can do about it. What makes you think I had
anything to do with that gold?"</p>

<p>It was of no use. They would not talk about it. I began to study the
schooner's course and try to figure out where in that vast area of
sea they could have let the stuff go overboard with the certainty of
getting hold of it again.</p>

<p>In a short time we met our own boat being rowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> rapidly after us, and
then we took her in tow and dismissed our motor boat, which had been
dragging along at the main channels. The men had earned their hundred,
and they departed, highly pleased at their luck, which represented more
than a month's profits fishing.</p>

<p>As our boat came alongside, we were hailed joyfully by Jim Sanders, the
coxswain, during my absence, and he held up a long line, at the end of
which was fastened a small buoy. The other we saw was fast to the small
trunk.</p>

<p>"We found it all right", said Jim. "We was rowing along fast after
you, an' suddenly my eye catches sight o' this here float. I grabs it,
and up comes that trunk fast to the other end in about ten fathoms of
water. That trunk is sure some heavy, and I reckon it's got the stuff
in it."</p>

<p>"Very good, very good indeed," cried the messenger. "Now things look
better."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the third officer, "this is what we are looking for&mdash;no
mistake."</p>

<p>"Hoist it right on deck," I said, and a line was passed to it. It was
all two men could do to get it aboard. When it was safe on the deck, I
went below and saw the doctor.</p>

<p>"We have the trunk with the gold all safe&mdash;now, what have you to say?"
I said.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" asked the doctor, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Not really, say not so," remarked the younger man, in mock alarm.
"Why, then you seem to have what you've been after, what you are
looking for. If that is all, you better let us turn the ship about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and continue our journey. Why didn't you say you were looking for that
trunk?"</p>

<p>A yell from the deck told me something was not right. I came up the
companion, and looked out, holding my pistol ready for trouble. The
messenger was standing at the side of the trunk. So also was Smith.</p>

<p>Two men had just opened it, and had dumped a lot of old iron and bolts
onto the deck, where they lay in a pile of rusty, wet junk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a moment I gazed in amazement at the littered deck. Then I smiled.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we could have made a mistake by any possible means?" I
asked the express messenger.</p>

<p>"Not by any chance, not a chance. This is a plant&mdash;why should they sink
this trunk with a line and buoy to it? It proves beyond all doubt they
have got the stuff somewhere. They dropped it, hoping we would stop and
haul it up, and they'd gain just so much time by the device."</p>

<p>"Then where in Davy Jones is the swag? Where could they have hidden it?"</p>

<p>"That's for us to find out&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>As we came in, a dozen boats came to meet us. The police took charge,
and the two prisoners were ironed and taken ashore. The schooner was
put in charge of detectives, and no one allowed aboard her.</p>

<p>We went back to the ship in our boat, and reported the capture of the
men, but the loss of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>money. Whereat Captain Hall was so angry that
he would not speak to me that day. I felt that I had done what I could
and that I was not at fault.</p>

<p>I could do no less&mdash;nor no more, for that matter. I went below, and the
ship went on to her dock, the passengers were sent ashore, and the dull
routine of the lay-up began.</p>

<p>I had some time now to myself, and studied the situation carefully.
It would be a month before the trial, and we would have made another
voyage before then. I was served, however, with a subp&oelig;na to appear
as a principal witness, and I put the paper away and took up the study
of the case with vigor.</p>

<p>The three men aboard the schooner who had acted as crew were not in the
game. That was evident, for they proved to be just plain fishermen who
had chartered their craft to the doctor upon an agreement made on his
former voyage. He had planned the coup, and made the vessel ready for
the getaway. That was certain. The men were discharged.</p>

<p>Every portion of the schooner capable of hiding a gold piece was
thoroughly probed. Even her masts were bored at intervals, and she was
hauled out and her keel searched for a hollow that might contain the
treasure. Everything that men could do was apparently done. But not a
sign of gold.</p>

<p>The two men, the doctor and his accomplice, were sent to trial, and had
the best lawyer in England to defend them, a man who did not work for
small amounts. I noted that fact and waited.</p>

<p>They were sent up for two years each solely on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>the circumstantial
evidence that they had occupied the room above the safe on that voyage
and that if any one had committed the theft upon a former voyage it
must necessarily have been discovered, as the safe was thoroughly
cleaned and refilled with a new cargo of gold for that single trip.</p>

<p>The schooner was sold at auction by the fishermen who owned her, as
they were afraid to run her under the continual scrutiny which the
company put upon her. She was broken up and her gear sold for junk.
That was the end of her.</p>

<p>It was thoroughly believed that the treasure was planted somewhere on
the course we had taken during the chase, and many fishermen dragged
the sea on that line in the hope of reward. But nothing came of it, and
a year passed.</p>

<p>The time came for the doctor and his pal to get out, for the law which
cut the prison term to one-half for good behavior was now in force. I
watched the papers, and tried to keep posted, but nothing was printed
about the convicts.</p>

<p>One day the doctor and his partner came aboard just as we were leaving,
and spoke pleasantly to me. They had taken second class and return to
New York. It was pure nerve, I thought, but the regulations allowed
them the privilege, as they might not, under the "undesirable-citizen"
act, be allowed to land in the States.</p>

<p>They took no pains at all to hide their identity, and greeted me most
cordially when I met them on deck the first day out. I asked them about
their sojourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> in Dartmoor, and they talked freely, telling of the
rigors of prison life.</p>

<p>"But it is all over now," said the doctor. "We will live our lives as
we always have, clean, honest, without fear and without reproach. We
were innocent, as you know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so&mdash;but what became of the gold?" I asked cynically.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the gold," murmured the doctor. "To be sure there was some
doubt about the&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;the disposition of the treasure
that the robbers worked so hard for. That will always be a mystery."</p>

<p>I thought differently. I had by the process of elimination long ago
come to the conclusion that the gold never left the ship in Europe.</p>

<p>The strange way they had taken their baggage ashore, their ostentatious
manner of taking out the heavy trunk and lowering it over the side in
full view of all was evidently meant for a purpose.</p>

<p>Why had they taken so much trouble to let all see its weight? Why had
they dragged it with them when, after all, it contained apparently
nothing but old iron? That it was to cover up the real effort of
disposition was growing more and more plain to me, but, then, where
could they have planted the heavy weight of gold?</p>

<p>They could not have dropped it in mid-ocean&mdash;that was absurd. It did
not occur to me for a long time that the hour down the bay from New
York out to the lightship might suffice to enable them to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>cut into the
through safe, which, of course, would not be opened until the other
side was reached.</p>

<p>It was upon a return voyage that an incident occurred that started my
line of research upon the American channel.</p>

<p>I noticed that in going down the bay we were forced&mdash;owing to the great
length of the ship&mdash;close to the Southwest Spit Buoy. The turn here
is abrupt, and, while the tide runs swiftly, there is a certainty of
position always for a large ship.</p>

<p>A smaller vessel might swing well out, but a vessel of the <i>Prince's</i>
size could not. Then the idea of the buoys marking the line at close
intervals came to me. It was just what they would desire for marking
their cache.</p>

<p>They could make a note of position, and drop their swag so closely
to an established position that there would be no trouble at all in
picking it up, even after a year's submersion.</p>

<p>The trunk must have carried the hot-chisel outfit, the electrical tools
for cutting, and these the burglars had tossed into the sea at the
first opportunity, afterward filling the trunk with junk for a blind,
feeling sure we would think it held the treasure.</p>

<p>I had studied the process of cutting with an electrical jimmy, the
melting of the plates, and I soon came to the conclusion that the job
was done, finished before the ship left soundings off Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>The pair were seemingly not well supplied with money, and I determined
to watch them after they got ashore. By some strange freak the
inspectors passed them, and they disappeared in the city, leaving no
trace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>"I want a two-weeks' leave of absence," I said to the old man that
night, "and I want it right away&mdash;I'll get the gold we lost or lose my
job. I'll take the third mate with me. Smith knows them."</p>

<p>There was some trouble getting officers to fill our berths on such
short notice, but the old man had some faith in me, and let us go.
I drew a hundred dollars in pay, and we went right to Brooklyn and
chartered a fast and powerful launch.</p>

<p>Then we ran over the course the ship always steered on her run out the
main ship channel, going close to the Southwest Spit Buoy.</p>

<p>We did not come back to town again, but remained in the boat for two
days and nights, coming in only to get gasoline and supplies, and then
keeping right on the run in and out to sea.</p>

<p>It was lonesome work, and we passed many small boats daily, but none
had the men we hoped for in them.</p>

<p>The third evening, just about dark, we noticed a launch running for the
red buoy at the turn of the channel near Sandy Hook. We both were much
disguised, being rigged with false beards and uncouth clothes.</p>

<p>In daylight no one would have recognized us thirty feet distant, and at
night we might have talked to our best friends without detection.</p>

<p>As we came in, running very slow, we noticed a boat with two men in her
near the Southwest Spit Buoy. The boat had stopped, and the men were
doing nothing. They seemed to be waiting for something.</p>

<p>We came past, sitting well below the gunwales of our craft, but
watching the other boat. When we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> came within fifty feet Smith sank
below the coamings.</p>

<p>"That's them all right," he whispered.</p>

<p>I watched the pair from the corner of my eye, and headed away from the
vicinity, keeping well down in our boat, and showing nothing but the
back of an old battered hat.</p>

<p>It was the doctor and his pal, and they were at work. They stood back
and forth across the channel a few times, and one of them held a line
towing astern. It was evident that they were dragging a grapnel over a
certain part of the channel marked by the buoy and bearings upon Sandy
Hook.</p>

<p>Before we were half a mile away, they were hauling in the drag, both at
it with all their strength, and we knew they had struck something.</p>

<p>It was necessary to decide at once what to do. If they had the cache,
we would find it; if they had hold of something else or were simply
playing to throw any one off the scent, they would keep their secret.
We decided to take the chance.</p>

<p>I swung the launch around, and opened her up to the limit. In an
instant we were flying toward them at fifteen miles an hour, and
within two minutes were in hailing distance. They saw us coming, and
hesitated. That hesitation made me sure of our game. They would not let
go the cache unless something dangerous was about to happen, the danger
of losing it altogether being too great. Smith jumped up, revolver in
hand, as the launch came tearing up.</p>

<p>"Hands up&mdash;stop that drag," he yelled. "We've got you, Doctor Jackson."</p>

<p>A flash flicked the gloom, and a sharp "pop"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> sounded, followed by
another and another. Smith dropped his gun, and fell into the bottom of
the boat.</p>

<p>"They got me," he gasped.</p>

<p>Then he raised himself upon his knees and, while I headed the flying
craft straight for them and opened fire, Smith rested his revolver upon
the coamings, and shot the doctor through the head.</p>

<p>Then the launch crashed into their craft, going at full speed, and her
sharp nose cut straight in a full foot and a half before she stopped.</p>

<p>The young man who had shot my third mate was snapping an empty gun at
me as he went over the side into the sea. I stopped the engine, and
jumped for him.</p>

<p>He dived, but as he came up I hit him over the head with a boat hook
that lay handy, and before he sank I had caught the hook into his
collar and dragged him alongside.</p>

<p>Then I lifted him into our boat, and as his face came close to mine I
recognized him as the former "wife" of the doctor, the robber who had
masqueraded as a woman and who was evidently the electrical expert of
the pair.</p>

<p>I passed a lashing upon him quickly, and then went to Smith. My poor
friend and shipmate was gasping in pain, lying upon the boat's bottom.
I examined him, and found two wounds, one through his arm and another
through his chest, both bullets being from a high-powered automatic and
having passed cleanly through.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I had anchored the wreck of the launch which had
swamped to the gunwales, and was running for the fort at the Hook,
where I arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> fifteen minutes later, with Smith unconscious.</p>

<p>Here I turned him over to the surgeon and, getting help from the
officer in charge, I ran quickly back to the buoy. The dead body of the
doctor was still lying in the swamped boat, and the men removed it.</p>

<p>Then I got a pull upon the drag line, and was not surprised to find it
caught to something very heavy. Three men helped me haul it in, and it
came slowly.</p>

<p>A bight of chain appeared upon the surface. We caught hold of this,
and hove it in also. At each end were iron boxes weighing at least two
hundred and fifty pounds each. In spite of our misfortunes I gave a
yell. It was the gold at last.</p>

<p>Young Simpson told how it was done after he had been turned over to the
authorities. He had already been sentenced for the crime, and would
therefore not have to suffer again, having served his term.</p>

<p>He told glibly how they had done the job during the two hours they
had after the treasure room was closed and the ship warping out and
down the channel. The time had been ample, and the rest of the voyage
was just to cover up, to throw us off the track. They had the cutting
outfit in the trunk that had weighed so heavy, and had taken it away to
throw overboard, which they did long before we came near them in the
schooner.</p>

<p>They had kept the trunk, but when they saw we were after them they
had sunk it with a buoy, knowing that we would probably see it in the
smooth sea and were aware of the old smuggler trick of sinking treasure
down at the end of a fine line and small mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>Then they had decided to make no resistance, believing rightly that
the easiest way was the best. They had taken their sentence based upon
the circumstantial evidence in the case, and they were just about to
get their treasure when we nabbed them. They had originally intended
to get it in their schooner at their leisure, but we had stopped that.
The location of the buoy at the turn of the channel marking the run to
sea was a safe place to drop anything. It would hardly be disturbed for
some time.</p>

<p>The heavy, small iron boxes had been made purposely for the work, and
the chains connecting them had been long enough to cover fifty feet, or
cross enough space to insure picking it up without delay when dragged
for.</p>

<p>The old man smiled when I reported for duty, but was sad at the thought
of our young third officer, who would be an invalid for many days.</p>

<p>"They are going to give him the first mate's berth in the new ship to
be out next season," said he, "and I'm mighty glad of it&mdash;he deserves
something."</p>

<p>"That's correct&mdash;he sure does, he worked hard, and took risks&mdash;and
Smith is a good man anywhere, a good navigator also. But did you hear
anything about me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sure; you're to stay right on here&mdash;chief officer, but they're going
to hand you one thousand dollars for taking one hundred and twenty-five
from the bottom&mdash;don't that satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"Mighty well indeed&mdash;mighty well indeed," I replied. "Shake, captain."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE JUDGMENT OF MEN<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h2></div>


<p>I had rowed in for fresh beef. The weather was cold, the water rough
and when Wilson asked permission to go up town to get tobacco, I let
him go and made my own way to the ship-chandler's, where we men of the
sea usually bought our supplies and sometimes spent an hour or two
discussing primage freights and other things pertaining to shipping.</p>

<p>There were two big five-masters lying just outside of us in the
channel and their masters were known to me. One of them had picked me
up at sea from a derelict and the other was Bull Simpson, well known
on the coast. Simpson was much given to gregariousness. Johnson was
companionable, but quiet, and I knew they would be in Jackson's store
that morning, for they would clear the next day.</p>

<p>The day was in midwinter. The gloomy sky whipped by the nor'wester
showed signs of snow. How one hates snow at sea! The nasty white stuff
making the decks like glass, hiding everything from view. The harbor
was white with the scrape of the cold wind, and the salt water froze
where it struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> in spray. Yes, I would go to Jackson's store. The
shipping looked too gloomy to contemplate any longer. I thought of the
frozen fingers handling canvas stiff as tin.</p>


<p>The stove, a ship's bogie, was red hot in the back room. Simpson was
there, long, lean and solemn. So was Johnson there, but he was smiling,
smoking and so glad to be in harbor that it stuck out all over him.
Captain Cone, master of a tramp steamer, sat near and warmed his fat
toes, his pudgy hands red with frost.</p>

<p>"Go back, they're all there," grinned Jackson to me, as I passed the
desk. "Thought you'd gone to sea&mdash;sech fine wedder&mdash;for gulls&mdash;what? Go
back an' set in, Cap; I'll come back for your order presently."</p>

<p>"Hello, you look cool," said Johnson, smiling up at me from his chair.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you&mdash;set in," said Simpson, making room for a chair near
the bogie. "Shake hands with Captain Cone of the <i>Prince Albert</i>&mdash;Cone
has a good tea-kettle for this weather&mdash;don't you wish you ran a tramp?
Please? No, I didn't hear that last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I bowed to the Captain. A captain of a tramp was something new to us.
We seldom had any but sailormen in the group and British skippers
were always looked upon as a rarity. Still they were always welcome.
Cone stuck out his pudgy hand. I squeezed the fat fingers until he
winced and withdrew them. I never cared for pudgy-handed seamen&mdash;just
prejudice, a meanness, but it couldn't be helped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> We can't help
everything, we must be human, and Cone took it good-naturedly&mdash;was way
above such things. He showed it by spitting voluminously at the bogie
and remarking it was very cold to go to sea.</p>

<p>Simpson didn't like it at all. He showed it, grumbled something about
Yankees and stiff-necked folks, then subsided while I lit up and gazed
complacently at Johnson. We talked of various things until Cone rose,
buttoned his coat and went into the office to fill his order. Simpson
glared at me for a moment.</p>

<p>"What's the use of being so damned short with the Britisher? What's he
done?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's what he hasn't done I object to," I answered. "Stupid, heavy
brute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Cone came back and extended his hand. "Good-by,
Simpson&mdash;good-by, gentlemen&mdash;hope you'll have better weather of it
to-morrow."</p>

<p>I noticed that he held out his left hand; it was the left hand that was
so pudgy, so fat and soft. His right hand was gloved and the fingers of
the glove were stiff, straight.</p>

<p>"Good day," I said, rising, "and good luck to you." Johnson nodded also
and the stranger withdrew, followed by Jackson who saw him to the door.</p>

<p>"Wake up," I said to Simpson. "Don't think I meant anything, but these
Britisher tramp skippers are the limit. High ideals! lots of feeling!
Human as a beef and twice as heavy&mdash;after dinner. Where did he blow in
from?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>"He came in for coals to take him to Brunswick&mdash;he'll load for lumber
there and go back home&mdash;hope he'll get a better reception than he got
here&mdash;he's a member of the English Masters' Association; you might have
been kind to him," said Simpson.</p>

<p>"Was he the man they fired from the Association last month? Seems to me
I heard of a Cone&mdash;seems like he was accused of brutality or something,
lacks humanity&mdash;looks like it, anyway," said Johnson.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was fired&mdash;yes&mdash;by God, he was," snapped Simpson, "and it
was just such judgment that gets lots of good men into trouble.
'Lacked human sentiment'&mdash;lacked human sentiment&mdash;well, that's a
charge for you! Hell! you fellows get narrower and narrower&mdash;I
happen to know Cone, knew him years ago&mdash;he was fired for losing the
<i>Champion</i>&mdash;'lacked human sentiment,' bah! Oh, now you remember him,
heh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we remember him&mdash;the man who lost a fine ship in collision in a
clear night," said I, with something of a sneer. "But that wasn't the
worst of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you read the damned papers&mdash;you got a fine idea of it all,"
snapped Simpson. The old seaman turned and spat viciously at the bogie
as if the poor old stove, red-hot, had done him some grievous wrong.
Then he turned scornfully to Johnson.</p>

<p>"You remember the <i>Champion</i>? You know something about her, you ain't
so damned stuck about yourself. I happened to be aboard of her the day
she sailed, talking to Redding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> her chief mate&mdash;Redding, that was lost
in the <i>Arctic</i>&mdash;yes, Redding was as straight as a string&mdash;and he told
me the details of that accident after he came from the hospital&mdash;too
late. He was nearly a year in the insane ward from a blow that smashed
his head, but he told me about Cone.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was Cone who left his wife&mdash;so they said&mdash;left her, deserted
her and the children. It was Cone who acted in every disgraceful way
the old women tell about, Cone who raised hell and paid the devil
wherever he went, Cone who only got command of the <i>Champion</i> after
pulling shares and playing the game for all it was worth&mdash;no, don't
tell me&mdash;don't, I say&mdash;I don't want to hear about what he did. I'll
tell you how he lost the ship, and you say you'll believe anything poor
Redding said&mdash;so would I. If there was truth in any man it was in Dan
Redding&mdash;poor devil."</p>

<p>"Yes," I assented, "Redding was all right."</p>

<p>Simpson scorned to notice me. He talked at Johnson, or rather talked
at me through Johnson, over him, and&mdash;Simpson could talk, talk like an
Admiralty lawyer with two noggins of rum under his ribs. Jackson came
in and took Cone's vacated chair. He rubbed his hands. Cone had been a
good buyer, had needed plenty of stuff&mdash;and he got it at the highest
rates. Jackson approved of Redding also, approved of him for the sake
of memory&mdash;Redding had always paid a full bill&mdash;never asked rake-off,
<i>pourboire</i>, "graft," or other money from him.</p>

<p>"You heard all that stuff about Cone, too," said Simpson, sneeringly at
Jackson; "and I dare say <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>you believe it like a good old woman you are,
but I'll tell you just how he lost the ship&mdash;if you believe Redding.</p>

<p>"They cleared at daylight, bound for St. John's&mdash;had twenty passengers
first class and about seventy second&mdash;no steerage those days. Redding
said the weather was hell and something worse from the time they
dropped the land, and you men know how it is on the coast in the winter
time. The old <i>Champion</i> came across and poked her nose into the fog
bank off Sable Island&mdash;bad place? Well, I reckon it is. Bad because you
can't tell where the devil you are and can't keep any kind of reckoning
in that current. That Sable Island bank is nearly as bad as Hatteras
for us windjammers.</p>

<p>"Cone slowed his ship that last morning&mdash;according to Redding&mdash;slowed
her down to a few knots, made the passengers keep off the decks in
order to have peace and quiet aboard. One old lady didn't like it at
all. She insisted she had a right to go where she pleased aboard&mdash;told
the skipper so to his face and dared him to put her below. Some of the
other women folks followed her example&mdash;did Cone do it? Well, he just
called his quartermaster and told him to remove the objectionable old
women, told him to carry them below if necessary&mdash;and that square-head
did. Yes, sir, he just picked up the leader and carried her off in his
arms while she screamed and clawed him, calling to the men to save her
from the brutal assault.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he got a nice name for that. The passengers told how
he acted, told how he brutally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> made his men remove innocent and
unoffending females&mdash;oh, what's the use? He was a brute and they made
it out plain&mdash;it was all published in the papers.</p>

<p>"It was along about five o'clock and the sun must have been well along
to the nor'west horizon, tho' of course he couldn't see it in the
fog&mdash;that a horn blared out faintly right ahead. The man on lookout
heard it&mdash;for it was now quiet on deck&mdash;and the siren roared out its
reply. Then he got a faint blow right off his starboard bow, a blow as
if from a small fishing schooner. He kept along blowing regular blasts,
kept along very slow.</p>

<p>"Right out of the setting sun a bit of wind seemed to make. It lifted
the bank enough to show him a four-masted ship standing right into him
not two hundred feet from his bow. She was heeling with the growing
breeze and going about six knots or better with just a white bone
across her forefoot. Cone rang off his engines.</p>

<p>"It is in these moments, you know, that things happen. Had Cone rang
ahead full speed like Chambers did in the old <i>Lawrence</i>, rang and
shoved into her full swing, he would have either gone clear or cut
out enough to give her his stern on the turn and probably not sink
either ship. He kept to the rules by British force of habit of abiding
by them&mdash;and, well, the <i>Potomack</i>, under three skysails and shoving
along with four thousand tons of cargo in her, hit him fair upon the
side while he was swinging to port. The ship's jibboom reached over
and drove a hole through the deckhouse first, poked right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> through and
ripped off his blowoff pipe, letting the steam come roaring out of
her, and then the heavy forefoot sunk like a wedge fair in her, right
in the wake of her engines. It was the worst possible place to get
it&mdash;you know that&mdash;right in the wake of the engines and close enough
to the engine-room bulkhead to smash it so it was useless. Then it
cut, shore down under the water line, and there he was with a hole in
him big enough to drive in a trolley car, a hole and nothing but the
forward bulkheads to hold him up&mdash;no, he was badly hit, hit right in
the vitals, and the roar of the steam told him plainly that the ship
was going to be put to it to float.</p>

<p>"Then came the usual panic.</p>

<p>"Cone tried to stop it, tried to stem the tide of passengers. His
officers were good, but Redding was hit on the head by a block from the
maingaff vang and while Cone was trusting to him to take charge aft, he
set to work forward to get the boats out in ship-shape and seamanlike
order. His second was a new man&mdash;Billings&mdash;a blue-nose he knew nothing
about, but a good enough fellow to take charge. He and the third
officer stood the crowd back for a time and got the port boats over.</p>

<p>"You see, it was smooth and there wouldn't have been much trouble, but
the passengers had a grouch against Cone, hated him. The women thought
him a brute and the men had heard so much from them about his private
life, his affairs, his general rascality, they wouldn't stand it any
longer. They rushed it and two were shot, one fell overboard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
another was badly hurt. These were the only casualties&mdash;strange, wasn't
it? Only passengers hurt were those who were trying to save themselves
from the brutal and overbearing Cone.</p>

<p>"The <i>Champion</i> settled quickly by the head, her nose getting well
down. This had the evil tendency of lifting her stern so high that the
boats couldn't be handled easily. It stopped the flow of the sea to a
certain extent, but it was too late to do anything to help that now.
The fireroom force came up, they were literally drowned out, forced to
quit, and the engineers came forward and told of the useless steam&mdash;not
enough to run the pumps. Then Cone knew it was get away while he could.</p>

<p>"Cone stood on the port side of the flying bridge, stood there and
roared out his orders, wondering why Redding didn't respond to the work
cut out aft. He saw no boats going over where Redding should be tending
to them, and when the crowd finally surged forward he had to let them
come, had to let them get into the boats there. Oh, yes, he was charged
with not holding them back, not being able to command his ship, but
man, he had to let them come forward, it was only the fighting ones who
insisted in getting first places and taking charge that got hurt.</p>

<p>"The <i>Potomack</i> lay to and sent in her boats, sent in four big
whaleboats and one dinghy. The water wasn't rough&mdash;any good boat would
live a long time&mdash;and Cone let them take off his passengers as fast
as they could. He was well scored for it afterward; they told how he
couldn't do it himself, and if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> hadn't been for the <i>Potomack</i> he
would have lost all his passengers.</p>

<p>"When the <i>Champion</i> settled Cone was still standing there on the
bridge, standing there and he knew what it meant to him.</p>

<p>"'You'd better go along, sir,' said Billings, 'we're going in the next
boat.'</p>

<p>"But Cone just looked at him for a minute, just stood there watching
things and saw the last passenger get away.</p>

<p>"'You hound,' the fellow yelled, 'you cowardly rascal&mdash;you insulter of
women!'</p>

<p>"You see, passengers get excited in such cases, get to lose their
heads. Cone never even looked at him, never took his eyes from the
settling ship.</p>

<p>"The engineer force had gone, the only men left aboard were the
quartermasters and mates. Cone spoke to Billings.</p>

<p>"'Get Redding and the rest&mdash;get in the boat, I'll come along in a
moment.'</p>

<p>"The <i>Champion</i> was settling fast now. The roar of the steam and air
from between decks was deafening. Billings didn't quite get the words,
but he knew he was told to go&mdash;and he went. The third officer found
Redding lying with a broken head and dragged him to the side, lowered
him down and started after him. Just as he did this, there was a
ripping noise from below. It was like a tearing sort of explosion, a
rending. Cone had disappeared from the bridge and they waited no longer
but shoved clear. At that instant the <i>Champion</i> surged ahead, lifted
her stern and dropped&mdash;she was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>"The suction whirled about, sucked the boat first one way and then
another, bringing her right over the foundering ship. Billings saw a
form jammed under the topmast backstay, saw a hand clutching something
white and he reached for it as the topmast went under.</p>

<p>"It was Cone. It was the skipper.</p>

<p>"They hauled him into the boat and he still clutched that thing in
his hand. He had been drawn under, been badly strangled and he was
unconscious, but his hand hold was firm and no one took notice of what
he held. It was the photograph of a woman.</p>

<p>"Billings didn't know anything about him; didn't know but what
the tales told were true&mdash;so he took the thing away from him and
said nothing about it; but Redding knew, Redding knew after he saw
it&mdash;months afterward when it was shown him&mdash;too late to stop the nasty
stories&mdash;oh, yes, it was the picture of his wife.</p>

<p>"Of course, Cone was living alone, had many affairs&mdash;so they said&mdash;and
it would not do to drag a woman into his ugly life. He had gone into
his room to get it&mdash;the picture&mdash;gone in to get it with that ship
sinking under him, the unsentimental and brutal Cone&mdash;oh, well, what's
the use?</p>

<p>"Yes, his hand was jammed between the backstay and the mast and
Billings just got him clear in time&mdash;funny, is it? Well, I don't know,
some men wouldn't have been so particular over a photograph, would have
used both their hands to fight clear with&mdash;what? But then, that's what
you call sentiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> No, you wouldn't expect it from Cone, wouldn't
expect to find it in a seaman with ruddy cheeks and quiet manner, soft
and a bit fat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Jackson, "you wouldn't expect a thing like that from Captain
Cone&mdash;that's right."</p>

<p>"No, you expect sentiment from the thin, poetical, big-eyed, tender
men, the men who slush and slobber it over at all occasions. You find
women looking for it in the tender talkers, the soft-spoken, the
amorous&mdash;oh, hell! did you ever see a man who looked the part&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I've sometimes had my doubts concerning heroes," said Johnson, "but
they are&mdash;the real ones&mdash;generally most common-looking, most quiet and
unassuming; but that Cone&mdash;well, he is a hard dose to swallow, and
that's a fact."</p>

<p>"Well, treat him decently when he comes back," said Simpson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some years later I met Cone at the dinner given by the Manager of the
Southern Fruit Company to the Captains of the West India fleet who ran
the steamers chartered under contract to fill the winter schedule.
There were as usual many British vessels in the trade, some Norwegian
and a few American, including myself.</p>

<p>Cone had passed entirely out of my ken and this time I took his hand
with the feeling that perhaps I had done the man an injustice by the
human judgment passed upon him. He was a very old man now and his hand
was still in a glove to hide the deformity which the accident had
caused. He looked <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>very much the kindly old-time shipmaster, bright
of eye and vigorous to the last. He sat near me and remained silent
during the opening of the somewhat formal repast. The Manager had been
discussing some subject, for he seemed to wish to follow it at once.</p>

<p>"A thing's either right or wrong," said the Manager didactically, as he
looked over the gathering. He paused for the effect of his words to be
felt. He loved platitudes, although the leading man in his business and
a millionaire. "A thing is either right or wrong," he repeated, "and
a man is either right or wrong. There's a difference between them as
plain as between black and white."</p>

<p>Captain Cone squirmed in his chair. He had listened to this sort of
thing before from the Manager. The Company, the greatest shipping firm
in the whole world, had paid him his salary, given him his liner and
here was the Manager setting forth again against the manner of trusted
employees who should know these self-evident truths. He interrupted.</p>

<p>"In fifty-five years spent knocking about the world upon every sea,
I've come to a different conclusion," said he quietly.</p>

<p>It was so different from the usual applause, the applause which
had already started and which would follow the Manager's splendid
appreciation of the obvious. Several diners&mdash;there were twelve at the
table&mdash;looked up quickly and wondered at the Captain.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you mean?" asked the Manager softly, amazed at the
interruption. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> coming to a point where he expected to
hurl a smashing argument against the methods of some men who handled
millions, and here he had been held up by a Captain, an employee of
his Company. There was a silence, awkward, impressive&mdash;and the old
seaman felt it, causing him to blush through his mahogany tan. He had
committed himself, and he was essentially a modest man.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly how to explain," said the Captain slowly. "These
questions of human analysis are so very subtle, so elusive&mdash;I am only a
sailorman after all, and perhaps I see things differently from the view
taken by landsmen. There is much in the point of view. But it seems
that I am still reasonable, still logical&mdash;and I am able to perform my
duties even though I'm seventy."</p>

<p>He paused, passed his brown hand across his grizzled forehead, where
the hair still hung thickly. Then he let it drop slowly down over his
beard and his eyes seemed to have an introspective look. He spoke very
slowly and with considerable hesitation as one not used to the ready
flow of language, words every one of which had a meaning.</p>

<p>"There was a small matter," he continued, "which called my attention
to the human judgment. I don't know how to tell it, but&mdash;well, you
remember Jones, Captain Jones, who had an interest in the oil ships?
Yes; well, I was thinking of him.</p>

<p>"Jones was one of the first oil carriers. That was before the Standard
took charge. I had sailed with him as mate long before the war.
He got a great tank ship&mdash;lost her. Then came the squeeze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> of the
Consolidated, then the death of competition&mdash;and, well, Jones lost one
thing after another. Froze out. They made him watchman at the office,
made him night watchman, a man who had once run a ten-thousand-ton
oiler, a man who had made them millions by his care and industry. Then
he sank to the gutter and on forty dollars a month he tried to wrest a
living for seven children&mdash;four of them girls. You know the old story,
the sordid details. Jones had to take on liquor once in a while. He
would have gone mad without a drunk at least once a month. He figured
that it was best to get drunk than go mad, best for his family. It's
all well enough to talk, for the chicken-souled loafers who preach
to their flocks and then get their living through the generosity of
silly women, to call poor Jones a drunken reprobate, a useless loafer,
because he drank. But the red-hearted men, the men who knew him, knew
what he was suffering, knew what weight was pulling him down. In two
years he never bought a suit of clothes. He never spent anything
upon himself&mdash;except at certain times he felt that he must undergo
relaxation, must get away from himself&mdash;then he would get drunk, very
drunk.</p>

<p>"His wife&mdash;oh, yes, he had his wife. She knew him, knew what he had
gone through&mdash;she saw he got enough money for rum, helped him, stinted
herself, slaved, worked&mdash;well, she did everything a poor, high-spirited
woman could do."</p>

<p>Cone paused, took a drink, a mere sip, from his glass of water,
then pushed it from him. The looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> of the guests annoyed him. A
prohibitionist from Maine glared at him and made him uncomfortable.
There was a half-suppressed sneer upon the lips of the Manager, but he
was a gentleman&mdash;and a host.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I was speaking of his wife," he went on. "She helped him, held
him up with a mighty soul, a tremendous strength for a woman. All
through the dark and gloomy life he led, sleeping in the daytime and
wandering about the desolate offices at night, she was always ready,
always willing to lend a hand, steadying, guiding, always sound in
judgment and above all ready at all times to make any sacrifice for
either him or the children&mdash;yes, she was a great woman&mdash;may the God of
the sea hold her gently where she lies in its bosom&mdash;dead? Oh, yes,
she died long ago. The worst of the affair came about when Jones fell
sick. He finally broke down under the awful strain, couldn't stand
it&mdash;no, the liquor didn't hurt him, he was used to that. It was the
despair, the dead weight of crushed hopes, the knowledge of an old
man unable to make good against the tide, the tide which was sweeping
his children down to hell. The oldest girl was twenty and forced to
work at a place where&mdash;well, never mind, it was the same old sordid
story of a young woman staying, sticking out at a place where it was
impossible for her to come out as she went in. Ruin, and hell for her
afterward&mdash;convention, we call it&mdash;but what's the use? She was the old
man's favorite, and it hit him very hard, very hard indeed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it very well. Poor old Jones, captain of a
ten-thousand-ton ship, owner of a quarter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>interest in one of the
biggest commercial enterprises in the world&mdash;six children and a wife
starving on forty dollars a month and the seventh child&mdash;yes, it
was pretty bad, especially bad for Jones, for he had done nothing
to deserve his fate, nothing but fight a combination which knew no
mercy. The relentless, implacable cruelty of corporations is well
enough known to you gentlemen. Their laws are like the laws of
Nature&mdash;transgress them and you must die. The laws of life are supposed
to be just, therefore it is probable that those of some corporations
are so likewise&mdash;I don't know. But they had smashed Jones. Crushed him
down&mdash;yes, there he was at forty a month, trying to forget, trying to
do something to keep his family alive, and then under the heaviest
strain he broke one day&mdash;broke and went down."</p>

<p>Many of the guests at the Manager's table had now resumed their
poise. Some at the farther end resumed conversation, overlooking the
story-teller and wondering a little at his bad form to monopolize the
talk of the complaisant dinner humor. But some of the men nearest
the Manager still listened and the old Captain watched them with his
dark bright eyes, eyes which seemed to sparkle like diamonds in the
light. They were the eyes which had pointed the way to many millions
of dollars' worth of cargo, many thousand passengers, and they watched
over them through many a wild and stormy night upon the bridge of his
ship in mid-ocean where the mind has much time to ponder over the
methods, the ethics of the commercial human.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>"I found him at the hospital," went on Cone. "He was shaky, but he
fought his weakness back and went home at the end of two weeks to find
his wife down with pneumonia and the house full of famished children."</p>

<p>Cone stopped speaking for a moment and gazed across the table at the
polished buffet, seeming to see something in the mirror back of it. The
Manager looked up, saw his gaze and spoke:</p>

<p>"I know there's lots of hardships, Captain," said he, "and I don't lay
it all to the drink habit. Let your glass be filled&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the old seaman. "I am old and forgetting my
story&mdash;I was just thinking a bit. This is not a temperance lecture at
all&mdash;no, no, that is not what I was thinking of." And he gazed at the
prohibitionist across the board who was fingering his napkin.</p>

<p>"No, the thing that I was coming to is this. Jones found things in a
desperate condition at his home. He must have money. It was an absolute
necessity to have medical attendance at once for his wife, and he
dreaded the free ward of the hospitals&mdash;he had gone into one once
himself and knew what it meant. He must have money for his children."</p>

<p>"A man might steal under those conditions without being very bad,"
interrupted a man sitting next to him.</p>

<p>"That isn't what he did," said the old Captain. "He met a friend on
the street while on his way to a pawnshop&mdash;and the friend heard his
tale. His friend was a bank messenger, at least he was carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> the
proceeds of a ship's cargo in a bag. You see, in those days, captains
were allowed to collect freights at certain points, being in the
companies, and these moneys were carried aboard the ship until she
reached her home port. Sometimes there were many thousand dollars. This
friend had been with Jones in the old days and he knew his history.
The money he carried was freights from an oil ship just arrived. There
was fifteen thousand dollars of it in gold, and it was the property of
the very corporation which had squeezed Jones and ruined him. Well,
the friend did the obvious, did the human thing. He opened the bag
and gave Jones just five hundred dollars in gold and then went along
to try and fix the matter up with the firm&mdash;it required lying&mdash;that
is bad; it required many other things which we will not discuss here,
but they are eminently bad, bad as they can be&mdash;and by dint of lying,
and pilfering, and&mdash;well, the friend made good the loss without ever
getting found out&mdash;yes, a horrible example, I admit. He made good the
five hundred and no one ever knew he was a thief. No one knows to this
day&mdash;except&mdash;anyway, Jones saved his wife, and at the end of the money
the friend helped him to buy into a schooner and he got command. They
paid twenty-five per cent. in those days and he pulled out making
enough to save the rest from abject poverty."</p>

<p>"But you don't mean you approve of that fellow, that thief who
appropriated other people's money, his employers' money, do you?" asked
the Manager in amazement. "The thing for him to have done was to have
gone <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>to the firm and stated the case, told of the poverty of Jones,
told how he should be helped. No human being would have refused him."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, the friend did just those things&mdash;afterward&mdash;and
as I said before, corporations know no laws but their own. They are
relentless as the laws of Nature, as implacable as the laws of health.
Go where there is cholera, get the germ into your system, and you
will understand what I mean. No human feeling, no sympathy&mdash;nothing
will save you but your own powers of resistance. You will necessarily
die unless you can stand it. Most people die. And it may be right to
have things this way&mdash;I don't know, I don't set up as a judge; I am a
sailor. But I am human&mdash;and I don't hate my neighbor, I don't look upon
my friend as my enemy. Perhaps I am wrong. Still the thief in this case
suffered much. He was for years afraid of being found out. That shows
the whole horrible futility of it all. He suffered more than Jones,
for Jones knew from where the money came, knew it was money which by
his judgment should have gone to him anyway. Jones refused to pay it
back and wanted to publish the fact that he had gotten even with the
corporation to the extent of five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>"Of course, he didn't do it. The friend persuaded him not to, and when
he went into the coaster he forgot to talk about it even when under the
effects of his drinks.</p>

<p>"You see, it was about that time the insurance troubles came about.
Marine insurance had a tumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> owing to the loss of several heavy
ships and other matters not worth discussing now. You were badly hit
yourself, I believe,"&mdash;and the old Captain nodded to the Manager,
who smiled acquiescence&mdash;"you told me at the time&mdash;if I remember
rightly&mdash;that one more vessel gone and you would go to the wall.</p>

<p>"The friend owned shares in that schooner, owned more than half of
her, and he it was that let her go out, made her go to sea after
her policies ran out. He would not stop her carrying, for it meant
laying her up and Jones would have to go ashore again until things
straightened out. It was the hurricane season and she had to go light
to Cuba.</p>

<p>"I remember something of the affair, for I happened to be on the dock
when she sailed. Jones was standing aft giving orders, and his wife,
with her three daughters, were below in the cabin. It was a pretty
picture of commercial life, a picture of a man doing his work with his
family or part of it around him, and I almost envied him his place.
What does an old liner skipper ever have of domestic life? Never gets
home, never sees his wife but once or twice a year, and the company
never lets her go aboard the ship at all if they can help it. Well,
she sailed out that August day, and the next thing we heard of him was
that his schooner was driven ashore during a gale. She rammed up on
one of the Bahamas, Castle Rock, I believe, and then broke up. Some of
the crew and his daughters were saved&mdash;he and his wife went down&mdash;lost
before they could get them ashore.</p>

<p>"And so there it is&mdash;did the men do all that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> right or did they
do all that was wrong? That's the question. Where is the line of
demarkation, where does the wrong leave off and right begin, or how is
the mixture to be sifted down? We go by rules, we must play according
to rules or the game becomes chaos. But do the rules always hold, do
they always cover every emergency? I don't know, but I believe there is
bad, or what is called bad, in all men, also there is good&mdash;it depends
upon the man&mdash;not the rule."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. The Manager gazed curiously at his guest.</p>

<p>"You say the schooner went ashore on Castle Rock?"</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;well, it was somewhere about there, I don't know exactly,"
replied the old seaman, annoyed.</p>

<p>"There never was a wreck on Castle Rock that I ever heard of," said the
Manager, eying the old Captain curiously, "but there was the <i>Hattie
Davis</i> that was lost on the Great Inagua Bank&mdash;she wasn't insured, I
believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was lost on the Great Inagua," assented the Captain, leaning
back, as though the story were closed.</p>

<p>"You had a large interest in her, I believe," said the Manager slowly,
"and I recollect, now, you lost all in her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The light was not so good as it is now," quickly put in the old
seaman. "It used to show only in clear weather&mdash;and it's almost always
clear through the passage&mdash;I remember how the passengers used to be
glad when we entered the passage coming up from Cuba in the old Panama
ships&mdash;rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> in the tumble off Maysi when the wind holds nor'east for
a spell."</p>

<p>The Manager was gazing at the old skipper strangely. Then he suddenly
turned and started to discuss other matters with his guests. The
dinner went along without incident and afterward we arose to go to the
smoking-room for our cigars.</p>

<p>"Come along with me, Cone," said the Manager, "I have a new orchid I
picked up I want to show you; you always liked flowers, you know."
Afterward I passed them and overheard the Manager saying in a low
tone&mdash;"Well, you always had a hell of a reputation, Cone, anyway,
but under the circumstances&mdash;well, there might be some sort of
justification. You are too full of that damned sentiment for any
business whatever. Still, I'll admit that it isn't so much what a man
does that matters&mdash;that is, it doesn't matter so much as <i>how</i> it is
done&mdash;and <i>who</i> does it."</p>

<p>And so this was Cone? This was the master who had earned a reputation
for some very queer things as seamen see them. I remember the old days,
the words of poor old Simpson who had long gone to the port of missing
ships. Sentimental Captain Cone, stout, grizzled, bronzed, the man who
lost his hand holding to the picture of a wife who had been false to
him and who had accused him of many things too hard to print. It was
strange.</p>

<p>I suddenly felt I would like to see Simpson, to acknowledge he was not
so far wrong after all.</p>

<p>"The judgment of man is not good," I said in answer to some question
relative to nothing concerning Cone, and with this platitude upon my
lips I went home.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">ON GOING TO SEA</h2></div>


<p>We sat together upon the quarter-deck under the awning of the <i>Harvest
Queen</i>. My own ship lay in the berth opposite, and I had come over for
a quiet smoke with Captain Large. He sailed in the morning, and was
bound for Frisco around Cape Horn. I would not see him again for a year
or two&mdash;probably never; but he and I had sailed together and I had been
his mate. We talked of things, confidences, the talk of old shipmates
who know each other very well, and who are passing to know each other
as memories. I had shipped five apprentices, two sons of prominent men
in the shipping circles of New York, and I wondered at the outcome.</p>

<p>"I never take them any more," said Large. "I took one out of here a few
years ago, and&mdash;well, I don't care to repeat the job."</p>

<p>"But the boys are good&mdash;signed on regular&mdash;what can they do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I'll tell you what one did in the <i>Wildwood</i> when I
took him to China. I don't know how to explain it. The strangeness of
it all, the peculiar development that came about under seeming natural
causes&mdash;hereditary, you will say, and perhaps that is right I have
often studied it over, often lain awake in my bunk wondering at it all,
what peculiar ideas grew in a brain that was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> human&mdash;almost,
for when you think of what he did you cannot believe he was quite so,
even though his father was the President of the Marine Association and
had commanded the best American ships in his day." The old skipper sat
quiet for some minutes and seemed to be thinking, studying over some
problem. His cigar shone like a spark in the warm night, but the smoke
was invisible. I waited. Apprentices were new to me. I had not had much
chance to study the training of youth. My own way had been rough. I had
at last gotten my ship after a life of strenuous endeavor and often
desperate effort, and I wanted to learn all I could. Men I knew. I had
handled them by and large from every part of the globe, and discipline,
iron discipline, was a thing my ship was noted for. She had a bad name.</p>

<p>"You see," said Large, his deep voice booming softly in the night,
"there is something intangible that a human being inherits from his
forbears. We look at the successful man as a target to aim at, an
idol we point out for youth to emulate. We don't always analyze the
greatness. A successful man is often so from the stress he puts upon
others. He will not stay in equilibrium. He keeps going on up, up
beyond the place his own production entitles him. He becomes predatory,
but unlike wolves or felines he preys upon his own kind.</p>

<p>"When President Jackson of the Bengal Line asked me to take Willie,
his son, I did so with the feeling that it was an honor conferred upon
me, the captain of one of the ships. Jackson had earned <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>his position
by his own efforts and fought his way up to the top. I remembered him
well enough when he was a master, but he was now President of the Line.
He had a very sinister reputation in the old ships, but that was all
forgotten now.</p>

<p>"Willie came aboard looking like a physical wreck. He was a slight
youth of fifteen, stoop-shouldered, pale of face, but with the eye
of his father, and the peculiar settling of the corners of his mouth
noticeable in the old man. 'Be sure you bring him back safely,' said
his father, giving me a look I long remembered. 'Be sure you take good
care of him&mdash;and bring him back.' I didn't quite know what he meant. I
don't yet; but I know why he said it. I began to think of it before we
were at sea a week.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was only a boy, a mere lad, but he was all of his father&mdash;his
father as we remembered him in the South Sea. Degenerate? He was the
ablest lad of his size I ever saw. He stood right there on the main
deck the day we went out and took little or no notice of him while the
tug had our line. He was signed on, mind you, signed on regular, so
as not to excite the comment of 'pull.' Hell! why do they send boys
to sea when the shore is the place to train them? He stood there and
saw me looking at him, thinking of the words 'be sure and bring him
back'&mdash;yes, I would.</p>

<p>"'Say, Cap, dis is fine. Let's put de rags on her an' let her slide.
I wants to see her slip erlong&mdash;t'hell wid towin', says me,' and he
came up the poop steps on the starboard side to chat with me&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> thing
no one, as you know, can do aboard a ship without a reprimand. Every
one heard him talking to me. He yelled it out in a shrill voice&mdash;yes,
talking to me, the captain, on the poop. 'See here, young man,' I said
to him, 'you mustn't talk to me while I'm on deck. Go down on the main
deck, and when you want anything, you ask the mate&mdash;he will talk with
you or get you what you want&mdash;you understand? It's not the thing to
ever speak to the captain of a ship without permission.'</p>

<p>"'Aw, fergit it, cully! Don't youse make no mistake erbout me. I spoke
fair an' civil to youse, an' if youse don't want to answer you kin go
to hell, you stuck-up old fool! D'ye git that right?' he said shrilly.</p>

<p>"Well, you can imagine what that sounded like to the men. Twenty of
them were grinning and both mates aghast. I was the master, a man known
the world over as a 'driver.' There was nothing to do but take the lad
in hand at once.</p>

<p>"'Take him forward and rope's-end him,' I said to Bowles, the second
officer, a man weighing two hundred pounds and a 'bucko' of the
strongest type. You remember him, the toughest mate afloat?</p>

<p>"But Willie looked up at me with a sneer.</p>

<p>"'You try it, you sea loafer. I'll sweat youse fer it if youse do. You
ain't de whole thing aboard here. Youse don't know me, I guess.'</p>

<p>"I had to do it. The affair had gone too far. Bowles grabbed him by
the collar and lifted him off his feet, and he let out a scream like a
wildcat&mdash;a most unearthly shriek. Bowles whipped him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> good and hard,
tanned him so he could scarcely sit down; but he just cursed and swore
at the officer, telling him what he'd do to him afterward. He got an
extra lick or two for this. Bowles paid no attention, but went back to
his station to attend lines. Half an hour later he was standing at the
rail when I saw a form shoot out of the galley door and drive a long
knife into his back. He sank down without a word, and Willie stood over
him ready for the finish. The mate knocked him down with a belaying pin
before he could kill.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible thing, an awful state of affairs beginning within
five minutes after the tug had let go. It was uncanny. A young boy
doing such things aboard a ship. I would have put him ashore at
once, but remembered the articles he had signed and the words of the
president of the line. I hesitated and the opportunity was lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would have made another," I interrupted. "I would have sent the
young villain to prison at once. No good could possibly happen from
such an agreement, no good come from a horrible little devil like that."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't quite know yet what to make of it all.
According to the usual rule there could be no good from a boy who
would deliberately commit such a crime; but we men who know life, the
real life, know that rules are not good to follow. You know that. I've
tried to figure it all out, but there is no answer, no accounting for
the strangeness of character that develop under certain conditions. We
tied Willie up while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> he was unconscious from the blow of the pin, and
instead of putting Bowles ashore we endeavored to bring him around. I
took him aft and sewed up the cut. It was an awful wound, but Bowles
was a very strong man. It took a month before he could get about the
deck again. We had run clear to the equator.</p>

<p>"In the meantime Willie had had another run in, and I had him brought
aft to have a little talk with him, to try and explain to him how a
ship must be run, the iron discipline and the custom of the master not
to associate with any one, either boy or man, from forward.</p>

<p>"'Aw, cut it out, cully&mdash;cut de langwidge! It don't go none wid
me&mdash;see? I comes aboard dis ship an' gets it in de neck de foist round.
Den I slings inter de bloke wot does the trick&mdash;'n by rights I ought
ter take a fall outer youse, Cap&mdash;'n I've a good mind to do it, too.
Dem sea tricks don't go none wid me.'</p>

<p>"'But don't you know I could hang you if I wanted to? Don't you know
my word is law here? I am in absolute command. If you don't follow the
rules of the ship I'll have to punish you severely.'</p>

<p>"'Nothin' doin', Bo, nothin' doin' at all. Youse kin cut all that sort
o' talk out when youse chins wid me&mdash;see? Say, Bo, whatcher take me
fer, anyways? Er "come on," er what? Whatcher t'ink I am, anyways,
hey? Go tell de little choild stories to yer gran'mother&mdash;don't
spring dem on me, don't try to hand me nothin' funny&mdash;I'm a MAN! An'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
don't youse t'ink youse kin take de call of me, neider, Bo, fer youse
makes a mistake mixin' it wid me! I'm a fightin' MAN&mdash;me fader'll
tell youse dat, an' dat's why he sends me wid youse when I might
be goin' to school. De old man is a lulu, an' I am his son, Bo, a
son of a dog&mdash;nothin' yaller in de breed; 'n if youse t'ink you kin
razzle-dazzle me you'll sure fall down. Youse take dat from me, Bo!
D'youse git it straight?'</p>

<p>"'I'll turn you loose if you'll promise to do the right thing from now
on,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Aw, no, Bo, I don't have to promise nothin'. Youse ain't got me right
yet. I ain't no child. What de hell's the matter wid youse, anyhow?'</p>

<p>"'All right, then, you'll stay locked up until the end of the voyage
and then I'll turn you over to the police, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'An' you'll pay like hell fer that 'f I does. Youse see!' he snarled.</p>

<p>"Well, what could I do? What would you have done under the
circumstances? The boy was not afraid. I knew his breed too well. I
knew his father. He would not suffer the smallest infringement of what
he believed to be his rights. He would resist to the death. He had
gone with a gang of young ruffians and had developed a certain sense
of what he believed to be right. He saw no law but that of absolute
equality; and there is no such thing. He was at fault. It was absurd
for men who ran a ship whose name was 'hard' to allow a little boy to
take charge, a little fellow not weighing a hundred pounds. I decided
to give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> a real whipping&mdash;a whipping that would make a permanent
mark in his memory. I hated to think of it&mdash;hated to really believe
it was necessary, for there is nothing so horrible as whipping a
man&mdash;and the lad was a man in his own opinion. There is absolutely
nothing so soul-killing, so fearfully degrading. I prefer the bloodiest
fighting always to the cold-blooded lash. I have seen men lose their
self-respect under the degrading stroke of the lash; and a man without
self-respect had better be dead. I studied the case and remembered his
father. He was a small man physically&mdash;I never knew a big man make a
good seaman; but he could take charge of a ship, no matter what kind of
creatures were forward, and he never spoke but once in giving an order.
The father had the same idea in regard to right and wrong&mdash;he never
forgave one, never forgot. Yet he had been a staunch friend of mine. He
had many friends who swore by him&mdash;and he was always to be relied upon,
you could always count upon him no matter what the cost to himself in
any emergency. It was his idea of duty&mdash;and he feared nothing at all.</p>

<p>"It was just a week later on a hot day when I had gone below to work
the noon sight that I became aware of a pair of eyes looking at me from
the top of the companionway, and as I looked up I gazed right into
those of Willie; but it was along the blue barrel of my own forty-five
caliber six-shooter. The gun had always been hanging close to my bunk
head&mdash;ready for emergencies.</p>

<p>"'Bang!' The shot came without a second's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>warning. The bullet tore
through my arm. I sprang through the bulkhead into the forward cabin
just as the second shot ripped me across the neck. I was rushing for
the doorway to the main deck and the third shot threw splinters in my
face as it hit the edge of the door. Willie was coming right along
behind me, and firing as he came&mdash;and I&mdash;well, I confess it, I was
running for my life. I heard his yell of derision, a shrill scream&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The mate heard the firing, and as Willie came through the doorway he
kicked him in the back and knocked him over. Then he jumped upon him
and stamped all but the very life out of him by driving his boot-heels
into his face."</p>

<p>I shivered with the intensity of the tale, the horror of it all. The
old man sat silent in the gloom and the spark of light from his cigar
end flared and faded as he drew upon it. He was thinking of the past. I
waited.</p>

<p>"Well, what was I to do? I was a man, a ship master, and here I was
with my arm shattered by a heavy bullet from a mere boy&mdash;or devil! What
could I do?</p>

<p>"Yes, then I whipped him&mdash;whipped him until the men turned away. I will
not tell you of it&mdash;it was too horrible.</p>

<p>"It was four weeks before I could get about the
deck from the effects of that pistol shot. I had little
medicine aboard. There I was limping about
with a broken arm, and there was Bowles limping
about with the tendons of his back cut through.
It was awful. The men grinned. Yes, the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
grinned at us. I had an extra padlock put upon
the stateroom where Willie stayed, and he was
kept tight after that.</p>

<p>"At the end of a month Willie was all but dead.
The terrific heat, the gases from the cargo and the
close confinement told upon his weak frame. I
saw that he would not last much longer. He would
die in the ship, and I remembered the words of his
father--'bring him back; be sure and bring him
back!' There was an old man in the crew named
Jim. He was half fish and the rest salt and rope-yarn.
He offered to take the boy in hand and try
to train him. I let him have a chance, always having
him close at hand to stop any trouble with a
pair of irons. And when he turned in the boy was
locked up again. But there was no talk of doing
right, no promise to be fair or obey orders from the
little chap. I saw he would break out at the first
opportunity and refused to give him one. I had
old Jim read the Bible to him every day to see if
I couldn't get him interested in religion. He liked
that part of the Old Testament where it is especially
bloody and deals with the desperate fighting
of men, but when it came to other parts he lost
interest.</p>

<p>"'Say, cull, do youse believe dat yarn erbout de
whale--say? Aw, gwan! don't spring nothin' funny
on me, Bo. Gimme some of de hot stuff or cut it--see?
Dat kid David was de stuff! Gimme some
more o' his work, or let it go at dat. He might
have hove de rock an' hit de giant in de neck--but
I doubts it; but maybe so, maybe so. Dat giant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
warn't no bigger'n Bowles, I reckon--'n I c'u'd do
fer him easy enough, as youse know. Yes, I c'u'd
a dun up dat giant all right wid any sort er weaping--knife
or rock--I'm a sort o' giant killer myself----'</p>

<p>"'You ain't got de nerve to do nothing like that,
boy. Shut up and listen!' said Jim.</p>

<p>"'Say, Bo, don't youse make no mistake erbout
me noive. I got de whole gang of youse beat to a
gantline. I c'u'd stick youse all back in de lazereet
an' not half woik. Aw, say, Jimmy, youse ain't
got me measure quite right--see? Guess onct more,
old boy; but go erlong an' read some more of de
fight to me. I likes it all right.' And so they
would chat together and I would listen to try and
fathom the boy's mind. It was peculiar. And yet
under it all was that vast ego, that immense regard
for the opinions of others--not alone himself--he
was too young yet, but for himself was the greatest,
the self-respect. He was a leader, a boy with
a soul--you may laugh when you think him a fiend,
a perfect devil, if you will, but he was all right in
some things.</p>

<p>"I was more afraid of Rose, my mate.</p>

<p>"Rose was a quiet man, a driver, and he had
struck down the boy and beaten him to a jelly.
The boy never alluded to it, never spoke of it even
to Jim. That's where the danger lay. I felt that
they would finish the fight when I let the lad loose,
and dared not do so for a long time. Once when
Jim had the boy on deck I caught Rose gazing at
him with a peculiar steady light in his eyes. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
just stood looking at the boy for nearly a full
minute--then the lad turned and looked right into
his eyes with the same peculiar steadiness--a stare
that was unblinking, yet not strained. Willie had
those light eyes, almost colorless, like his father.
So had Rose, and they told each other so plainly
what was behind their eyes that I almost smiled;
but it was no smiling work, even if there was a
boy in it. Rose showed plainly that he would wring
the boy's neck at the first outfly, and was regardless
of consequences. Rose was not a man to trifle
with, yet when you remember that I was shot and
the second mate cut, there was reason for the chief
to throw out all sentiment. And so I kept Willie
under Jim's care until we reached Hong-Kong.
Then the old seaman wanted to go ashore and take
the boy with him, promising not to go near a grog-shop.
You can't trust a windjammer ashore after
a long voyage, no matter how good a man he is.
Jim came back to the ship that night the worse for
wear, and told a tale of the boy slipping away from
him in the streets. The man was drunk and I had
him sent down in irons. Then I sent out a call for
the police.</p>

<p>"They found Willie, who had wandered off while
Jim was drinking. The boy had walked the streets
all night, not caring much about the ship, and because
a Chinaman would not cut off his queue and
make him a present of it, the boy had jumped him
with a knife he had procured and tried to take it by
force. The interference of the police was all that
saved the boy's life, for the man's friends helped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
him hold the lad, and they were just in the act of
cutting his throat when help arrived. I was almost
sorry for the interference, but I remembered the
words of his father.</p>

<p>"Jim being unable to take further care of him
for the present, I locked him up myself and turned
in, being tired from the night's work. The next
evening I saw Mr. Rose dragging Willie aboard
the ship. How he got adrift I don't know, but he
carried in each hand an oil can, while the mate,
holding him, forced him aboard.</p>

<p>"'Say, Bo, whatcher think I done--hey? Just
watch dat junk dere lyin' in de next dock--see?
Aw, chee, dem Chinks is de limit. Dat feller what
got me in Dutch last night is aboard dere, an'--well,
you jest watch him now and tell me what
youse t'ink o' me, anyways. I remembers him, but
most all Chinks looks alike to me. Anyhow, I fire
her up fer fair--you watch her--see? Oh, say,
Bo, what a pipe----'</p>

<p>"Even while he spoke the black smoke poured
from the fated junk. She burned like a box of
matches. She was full of camphor wood and
grease, and she fired the entire dock, burning six
other vessels and making it so hot we were forced
to warp into the stream.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't give the boy up. I suppose I might
have done so and seen him hung properly. I said
nothing, and Rose was a very quiet man. The
damage he had done apparently took the lad's mind
off his former troubles, and on the way home I let
him go back to his watch. He took to the rigging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
like a monkey. I will say here he was the best
sailor I had ever seen. There was nothing he could
not learn about seamanship. He would always take
the weather earing in a blow and no man dared to
send him in. When Jim was on deck the old seaman
kept him under his eye in case of trouble, and
Mr. Rose was always most vigilant. The mate had
determined to kill the lad at the first sign of danger.
I tried again and again to win his confidence,
but he seemed to look upon me as his enemy. He
refused to take me for a friend, and my little talks
were futile.</p>

<p>"'Aw, tell it to yer gran'mother,' he would say
to me. 'Don't try to stuff me, Bo. Youse had
your innings at that--now fergit it before you git
inter the soup ag'in. I knows youse, an' I ain't
done wid youse yet, either--see? Youse done me
dirt--youse done me when I first come in de ship.
I ain't decided just what I'll do to youse yet, but
youse better keep yer eye liftin' fer me. Don' try
to razzle-dazzle me none. I ain't afraid of youse
at all. You ain't got de noive to do me--see? But
I got it in fer youse all hunk, now don't make no
mistake erbout dat. I'll let youse off easier the
better we gets erlong--see? If we gets erlong all
right I may let youse down easy--if not, I'll kill
you as sure as I breathe, an' that goes as it lays.
Do youse git it right?'</p>

<p>"Here was a boy, now sixteen, telling the master
of a ship he would kill him if things were not to his
liking. What do you think of it, anyway? I never
could work it out I couldn't lock him up any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
more for it would have killed him--and I must not
kill the lad--I don't know----</p>

<p>"The whole affair was insane. It was grotesque.
But there was my shattered arm, and there was
Bowles limping about--that fire at Hong-Kong--and
I must bring Willie back home. I'm telling
you a true story. I'm telling you of a boy, an apprentice.</p>

<p>"When we struck the rough weather of the high
latitudes Willie was happy. He was worked out to
a gantline by Jim, and he was beginning to run the
men a bit. It was amazing and absurd to hear
that kid yelling orders to the men aloft. Slack-away'
or 'clew up,' whatever the order was, and
he was very smart. He could beat the best of them
to the royal yard; and he was taking pride in it.
His voice was at that stage when it cracks and
goes into a treble, and no one laughed. Even the
mate watched it all with gloomy eyes, never saying
a thing, and never even smiling. And it was amazing
how the men obeyed him. If a man failed to
do so, only an apology and the reception of a kick
upon the stern would save him from a fracas, for
Willie kept right after them. Yes, he inherited all
the masterly qualities of his father. He was a
wonder at seamanship. One day a dago didn't like
the way Willie trod upon his feet when they were
both hauling a brace. They mixed, and it was the
closest shave for the lad. He came out with a bad
cut, for the dago at sea takes to a knife like a babe
to milk. That night, while in his bunk, the dago
was slammed over the head with a handspike, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
we had to keep him off duty until the ship docked.</p>

<p>"When we came in Jim brought his charge aft
to sign off, as is the custom, you know, for their
slop chest accounts. Willie came up.</p>

<p>"I haven't got much against you, Willie; you owe
me for a couple of plugs of tobacco, but we'll let
that go," I said.</p>

<p>"'No, we don't, Bo; youse charge it all up right
an' proper. Den I got a small account agin de ship--which
I'll settle right now----'</p>

<p>"But old Jim was too quick for him.</p>

<p>"'Take him forward and keep him in irons until
we get in. We'll get inside before dark,' I ordered.
You know how it is when a ship comes in. The
land sharks were there in swarms, but among them
was old man Jackson waiting for his son. They
went away hand in hand, the old man never even
speaking to me--I always thought he knew.</p>

<p>"Our cargo was valued at about half a million.
It was nearly all Jackson's, as he owned the greatest
shares in all the ships. We docked and were
forced to lay right behind a barge loaded with dynamite,
nearly two tons of it ready for taking out
in the morning to blow Hell Gate rock.</p>

<p>"Bowles had gone ashore with the rest, and Rose
had stepped up the street for a 'first night' off. He
was not due until midnight. I always suspected the
second officer or the dago--I don't know, only
neither of them ever showed up again. They both
had seen the President of the line take his son, his
young hopeful, away with him. They both had
suffered much from his hands. Perhaps it was revenge--to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
try to get even with the father for the
son's sins. Anyhow, I had hardly turned in that
night, leaving old Jones, the shipkeeper, on deck,
when the old fellow ran below and told me the
ship was afire forward. I turned out instantly and
was on deck.</p>

<p>"The ship was burning like a beacon from the
foremast to the t'gallant forecastle. She seemed
to be spread with oil. Jones was seventy and unable
to do much. I ran forward and yelled for
help. In ten minutes the engines were playing a
stream upon the ship and a fireboat was flooding
her from aft. Jackson came down on the run to
see his vessel being destroyed and his cargo vanishing
in black smoke. He had had trouble with
the insurance, and he was worried. Then while
he stood upon the dock and spoke to me as I stood
upon the rail amidships, I was aware of a small
figure near him.</p>

<p>"'Aw, say, Bo, youse better get away from
there--cut out, see? There's powder to blow youse
to hell and back right there in that lighter. Youse
ain't got more'n a minute, cully. Better git gay
wid de lines.'</p>

<p>"Then I recognized Willie. He had come down
to see the blaze and was calling attention to the
thing we had forgotten for the moment.</p>

<p>"'Call de watch, an' I'll lend youse a hand.'</p>

<p>"I called for Jones to slack off the after lines,
and then I ran as far as I could into the smoke and
managed to cast off forward, getting nearly
drowned with the engine water. Jackson came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
aboard and worked like mad. The stern lines were
cast off, but before we could do anything the ship
began to swing right down upon the barge. The
slip was too narrow to get the dynamite past the
vessel, and there she was now surging ahead upon
it. She had both blocked the slip and surged into
it. I began to yell to the men standing about to
get away from the place before the explosion. They
had crowded about as close as they could to see
the fire, not knowing anything about what was on
the barge.</p>

<p>"Jackson rushed aft and howled to the fireboat
to pass a line, as the wind was now blowing her
slowly across the slip and right upon the dynamite.
Every one who could understand me began to run.
The dock cleared off quickly. Then, just as I was
about to jump ashore myself, I heard a voice close
to the rail.</p>

<p>"'Aw, say, Bo, give me a heavin' line--I kin
swim acrost the slip--den hurry up an' bend de
hawser, youse can heave her over easy enough.
Don't get nutty.'</p>

<p>"I saw Willie standing there, and without further
ado I threw him the end of a small line. He
jumped in without a word and swam rapidly across
the narrow stretch of water to the other dock. A
man on the pier reached down and took the line
from the lad. I had already bent on the hawser,
and it went across lively. Then taking the end to
the midship capstan, I got old Jones to hold the
turns while I walked her around as fast as I could.</p>

<p>"But I was not strong enough to warp a heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
ship across a slip even in still water. The ship
surged ahead slowly in spite of all I could do, and
Jackson grabbed a capstan bar to help. It was a
poor chance at best, but we worked on. I caught a
glimpse of a slight figure working upon the deck
of the barge, throwing cases of powder overboard.
A man appeared with him, but I could not take time
to see much. The boxes were cases of about a
hundred pounds each, and they were rapidly going
overboard, and with the tide through the dock.
Minutes passed, but nothing happened. We seemed
to be getting way upon the ship, and Jackson swore
and strove mightily to save her, with no thought of
leaving even in the face of a terrific explosion. We
would have gone clear all right but for the fact we
had our port anchor over and hanging from the
cathead. We had warped the ship clear of the
barge, and her bow swung over, the line being too
far aft and the fire and water too dangerous to
work in forward. The fluke of the anchor swept
a pile of boxes--about three hundred pounds---and
then came the crash. It was terrific. The fluke
was clear of the ship's hull by several feet, but it
was blown through the deck, the five-thousand-pound
anchor flung like a toy through her side.
She shook from end to end. We were all blown
flat, stunned, although we had many feet of solid
vessel between us and the blast.</p>

<p>"When we came around from the shock of the
explosion Jackson had the pleasure of seeing his
ship without a bowsprit, her nose blown clear off,
but the fire was blown out. There was not even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
much smoke left. The barge had entirely vanished.</p>

<p>"The firemen came aboard afterward, and so did
many shipmasters, whose vessels lay in the vicinity.
Jackson met them dumbly. He said nothing.</p>

<p>"'Good thing they got the dynamite overboard
quick enough,' said Captain Smith of the <i>Sunnerdun</i>.
'That boy, whoever he was, was all right.
The watchman ran away just before the smash.'</p>

<p>"'What boy?' asked a fireman.</p>

<p>"But it was no use to tell us what boy--we knew,
we felt, it all along.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the end of him. He had tried to
save the ship, his father's ship--and he had done it
when men failed--I don't know--I can't judge him.
Old man Jackson left without a word, and I never
saw him again."</p>

<p>The old seaman paused, and the night showed
his cigar end flaming again. I sat there thinking
over the tale, the true tale of that boy, for I knew
Large was telling me only facts. It was all very
strange, all like a horrid nightmare the old seaman
had suffered from; but it was not a dream, it was
the truth about a boy, just a rough, tough boy
whose ideals had been a bit peculiar. I looked over
across the berth at my own ship, where five boys
were already signed on for the voyage around the
Cape, and I began to wonder if I had done a wise
thing to ship them. Then I determined right there
to give them some extra thought and study, to try
to fathom what lay behind their "going to sea."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
